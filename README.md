The project includes:
- Data cleaning, analysis, and visualisation of guest journey data.
- A predictive model that clusters guest behavior.
- An API to serve model predictions and key insights.

##Running the model
To run the model, follow these steps:

###Run Docker compose
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```
###Access the model:

## Model Parameters

#### Adjust Parameters:


#### Frames per Second (FPS):
FPS determines the simulation speed, with each step representing 30 minutes.

## Model Output

## Additional Notes

The  model is designed to enhance wait times at Universal Studios Singapore (USS) by analysing and optimising the entire guest experience.

By adjusting various parameters, you can explore their impact on guest satisfaction and operational efficiency, focusing on reducing wait times and improving guest flow.
