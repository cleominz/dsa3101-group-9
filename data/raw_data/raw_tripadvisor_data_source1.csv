However, admission is about all that gets you. You won't be able to ride many rides unless you fork over an extra $120 SGD for a fast pass. In mid afternoon, the wait for all the major rides was over 2 hours. Sorry, but I'm not standing out in the hot sun for 2+ hours for a 3 minute ride.  As a result, we got in only 4 rides (none major) during our 7 hour stay. <br /><br />And as others have mentioned, it's not nearly as big as the American parks.  Still, if you are not all that interested is the rides, it can be a fun way to spend a day. We are still glad we went.","Couples","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/2d/57/ec/81/caption.jpg","Written September 3, 2024","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

That said, it was brilliant fun and we managed to get on every single ride in the space of 6 hours including a drink stop and a lunch stop (pizza was actually pretty good).<br />Although expensive I’d say the Universal Express pass is really an essential if you want to ride on all the good stuff…..we reckon without those passes we would have managed 2-3 rides at best as some of the queues were c90 minutes (longest we queued was probably 10 minutes).<br />The water ride in Jurassic Park is great fun but atleast one person on each tube will likely get absolutely soaked (in our case me!) so a good idea to keep that one until the back end of the day unless you like feeling damp!<br />Top 5……Cyclone was the best, Mummy second, Transformers third, Human fourth, Jurassic water slide fifth.","Family","0","","Written August 27, 2024","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

You should prepare for the heat. There are several spots where you can drink water, so you can use it in case of emergency. Prices in the park are high, with a 250ml can of Coke costing $4.

We bought the Rise and Dine tickets so that we could get into the park early (8am) to get a head start on the rides before the crowds descended. <br /><br />We Managed to get on all four rides that were open to us with our passes and even got a second go on Transformers, before eating breakfast (which was very nice) and getting over to the temporary barrier to allow us into the rest of the theme park at 10am. This gave us time to grab a locker and get onto the Mummy Returns before the queues began. <br /><br />Sadly, the Battle Star Galactica Cylon was closed down whilst we were in the queue and didn’t reopen whilst we were there but that didn’t hinder our fun as we got on all of the other rides (bar one) without having to queue longer than 50 minutes. I’m so pleased we bought the Rise and Dine tickets though as I don’t think we would have gotten into nearly as many rides if we’d entered the park at ten o’clock and would have been queuing much longer. <br /><br />Tip - the rapids ride does leave you completely soaked to the skin - more so than any other rapids ride I have ever been on. To be fair though they do have vending machines all along the sides where we were queuing but being northerners (England) we just thought people were going OTT - turns out they weren’t!<br /><br />Luckily for us, there was a drying machine just outside the ride and together with the heat and sun we were almost dry by the time we left the theme park later that day - although trainers were still damp! <br /><br />Finally, the food was really good too! We went to the Diner themed restaurant near to the New York area, back toward the entry of the park and had a variety of burgers, all of which were really fresh and tasty.","Family","0","","Written August 22, 2024","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

My wife waited in the park to see if I might go outside to the monorail station, and I was the only one who went outside to look for it but couldn't find it.

However, admission is about all that gets you. You won't be able to ride many rides unless you fork over an extra $120 SGD for a fast pass. In mid afternoon, the wait for all the major rides was over 2 hours. Sorry, but I'm not standing out in the hot sun for 2+ hours for a 3 minute ride.  As a result, we got in only 4 rides (none major) during our 7 hour stay. <br /><br />And as others have mentioned, it's not nearly as big as the American parks.  Still, if you are not all that interested is the rides, it can be a fun way to spend a day. We are still glad we went.","Couples","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/2d/57/ec/81/caption.jpg","Written September 3, 2024","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

That said, it was brilliant fun and we managed to get on every single ride in the space of 6 hours including a drink stop and a lunch stop (pizza was actually pretty good).<br />Although expensive I’d say the Universal Express pass is really an essential if you want to ride on all the good stuff…..we reckon without those passes we would have managed 2-3 rides at best as some of the queues were c90 minutes (longest we queued was probably 10 minutes).<br />The water ride in Jurassic Park is great fun but atleast one person on each tube will likely get absolutely soaked (in our case me!) so a good idea to keep that one until the back end of the day unless you like feeling damp!<br />Top 5……Cyclone was the best, Mummy second, Transformers third, Human fourth, Jurassic water slide fifth.","Family","0","","Written August 27, 2024","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

Everything about the park and rides is available on videos and website, hence I will only talk about my suggestions. Firstly, express pass is almost a necessity if you want to explore the park completely in one day, so do buy the same. The additional cost was 120 dollar per person. Do visit early in the morning when it opens to give you maximum time to explore the park. Some of the best rides which we liked are:, the transformers, revenge of the mummy, lost world rapids, in addition to the roller coaster rides in transformer zone. Do not spend too much of time on the hollywood zone in begining. You can start from transformer zone, move to ancient egypt and then lost word and then cover hollywood in last. This way you will be able to avoid too much of rush occurs in these zones in the second half of the day.","Family","0","","Written August 15, 2024","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

Over crowded and poor customer facilities.","Extremely crowded and more people were still lined up to enter including large school groups. They need to control entry/limit number of people otherwise it's a waste of time and money. Every attraction had a long wait and some of them appeared shut. The whole place was over crowded even though it was a weekday and with the heat and humidity wasn't worth the effort. Need to have some cooling /airflow mechanisms given the rush and general weather. Quite disappointed and won't recommend.","Couples","0","","Written August 16, 2024","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

Everything about the park and rides is available on videos and website, hence I will only talk about my suggestions. Firstly, express pass is almost a necessity if you want to explore the park completely in one day, so do buy the same. The additional cost was 120 dollar per person. Do visit early in the morning when it opens to give you maximum time to explore the park. Some of the best rides which we liked are:, the transformers, revenge of the mummy, lost world rapids, in addition to the roller coaster rides in transformer zone. Do not spend too much of time on the hollywood zone in begining. You can start from transformer zone, move to ancient egypt and then lost word and then cover hollywood in last. This way you will be able to avoid too much of rush occurs in these zones in the second half of the day.","Family","0","","Written August 15, 2024","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

They had a wonderful time and this was the highlight of their trip. However, I have visited the location in California, and this is certainly nothing like it. The California one has a train that goes around the studio, and the shows are amazing. The shows at the Singapore one weren't that great. I did not like the Stephen Spielberg one at all. The wait was long, it was extremely hot and the fans do not rotate so you are left waiting. Then when you enter there is a long boring talk, then you go to another room where they show special effects. It pales in comparison because at the LA one you have a proper show. Waterworld lines were very long so we skipped that since it was so hot too. The food was okay, barely any place to sit since all the tables were fully occupied.<br />Express costs a lot of money - with the ticket prices plus SGD 120 per person for express, we spent almost SGD 600 for 3 people. They nickel and dime a lot. The drying pods outside the water rapids ride cost SGD 5. The ponchos cost SGD 6. After paying such a hefty fee, you don't expect them to nickel and dime so much. My kids had a lot of fun and that was the point, but if you have been to the LA one, this one really doesn't measure up. You have to get express during peak time. Lines had 60-90 minutes wait for Battlestar Galactica and the like, and with express you basically are in and out in 10-15 minutes. When we saw the long lines we were so grateful for express even though it was so expensive. Within 4-5 hours we were done with all our rides and a couple of shows. Shrek 4-D was good but the talk before they open the doors was awful, just awful. It is long, unnecessary, everyone is just standing around waiting, kids are losing patience, and nobody is listening to the lady giving instructions and repeatedly asking people to move. Everyone was just busy taking selfies. What has this world come to! We almost left since we were so tired but then the doors opened and we enjoyed the show. I recommend Universal only if you have not been to the LA one and if you have young kids who enjoy rides.","Family","0","","Written July 18, 2024","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

It was 36' and bright sunshine today which made waiting in lines difficult with two little ones (5&9yo). I would recommend going late afternoon if you can as from about 4pm onwards it was cooler and we were jumping onto rides with 5-15min wait times whereas when we first got there at 12 our first two rides were 45ish minute waits. If you can afford it buy the express pass it's so worth it if you want to do all the main rides. My thrill loving 9yo loved the mummy, raptor rapids, puss in boots and transformers and the Lights camera action show. My tamer 5yo preferred the sesame street, minion show, water world show and spotting the characters for photos. Something for everyone. As expected food is expensive, it was 17dollars for a kids chicken KFC style meal.

No stress with booking time windows for fast passes - we used our passes in the middle of the day only and also did some single rider passes so that we went on every single ride in the park, the Mummy 4x, both rollercoasters 4x (right at the end of the day) and also caught a show and sat down for brunch and lunch. <br /><br />It was one of my favourite park experiences - we are not gurus but have done both Disneys in California and the one in Tokyo and this was just as, if not more, fun.","Family","0","","Written July 17, 2024","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

It was 36' and bright sunshine today which made waiting in lines difficult with two little ones (5&9yo). I would recommend going late afternoon if you can as from about 4pm onwards it was cooler and we were jumping onto rides with 5-15min wait times whereas when we first got there at 12 our first two rides were 45ish minute waits. If you can afford it buy the express pass it's so worth it if you want to do all the main rides. My thrill loving 9yo loved the mummy, raptor rapids, puss in boots and transformers and the Lights camera action show. My tamer 5yo preferred the sesame street, minion show, water world show and spotting the characters for photos. Something for everyone. As expected food is expensive, it was 17dollars for a kids chicken KFC style meal. Lots of water stations around though so bring a bottle.","Family","0","","Written July 18, 2024","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

No stress with booking time windows for fast passes - we used our passes in the middle of the day only and also did some single rider passes so that we went on every single ride in the park, the Mummy 4x, both rollercoasters 4x (right at the end of the day) and also caught a show and sat down for brunch and lunch. <br /><br />It was one of my favourite park experiences - we are not gurus but have done both Disneys in California and the one in Tokyo and this was just as, if not more, fun.","Family","0","","Written July 17, 2024","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

Big bang for your buck. <br /><br />Like everything in Singapore, Universal Studios it is so clean and well run. From the moment you walk in, to the moment you leave and everything in between.

Worth every cent!","A stone's throw away (like 1-stop on the metro line) from the Oasia Resort Hotel. You could easily walk it, if you feel emboldened to sweat a little or run the gauntlet of rain storms. <br /><br />Like all great iconic Hollywood studios, expect people. Lots of them! <br /><br />Best advice I can give anyone is to pay for the Express Line. Nothing beats leap frogging lines and not hanging around....especially with sweltering humidity. Big bang for your buck. <br /><br />Like everything in Singapore, Universal Studios it is so clean and well run. From the moment you walk in, to the moment you leave and everything in between. I enjoyed the fact that it was not like a Disneyland with Mickey Mouse and Goofy overkill. There was literally everything for all ages including adrenalin junkies. For me, I was more docile and up for getting wet and a slower pace of watching Hollywood past and presents foisted down my throat.","Family","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2c/b5/26/6d/caption.jpg

Would have postponed but we didn't enjoy the prospect of having to visit during the weekend. By the time we got our bearings, the first ride I went on was Transformers. Went through the single rider queue and literally walked straight to the front (Apparently, the normal queue had a bit of a wait though). Went for a bite to eat and by the end was already 4.00pm so with not much time in the park I looked online which rides were the ""unmissable"" ones. Waited for my opportunity to ride Jurassic Park, Revenge of the Mummy and Battlestar Galactica. Was almost 5pm when I rode in order The Mummy (15mins wait), Jurassic Park (20m wait), Battlestar Galactica (15m cylon, 30m human). Of these, Jurassic park was probably the least worthy of a wait. Spent the ride spinning round anxious I'd start to feel naseous, only for a couple of semi-exciting drops before the ride end. <br /><br />Obviously, given more time we would have tried to experience a few shows as well but with a big family including children it was difficult to make it for the specific times. We did catch the trolls show which is cleverly scheduled as the last show of the day and located at the exit of the park. <br /><br />I was surprised by the lack of queues at the rides and dismissed it as the period possibly being low season. It could also be that I queued so late in the day. Luckily, didn't purchase the express pass. I would have been livid. I imagine if we entered at park opening the queues would have been much longer but by an hour before closing most people were exhausted and had already left.<br /><br />If you're going to Singapore, honestly there's not a huge number of other things to do so Universal is worth the visit. It's a bit pricey but you've decided to visit Singapore so trying to save money is already out of the window. On the flip side, it's not something that I would visit Singapore just to visit though. It doesn't reach the scale of a Disney World or Universal Florida.","Family","0","","Written June 10, 2024","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

Would have postponed but we didn't enjoy the prospect of having to visit during the weekend. By the time we got our bearings, the first ride I went on was Transformers. Went through the single rider queue and literally walked straight to the front (Apparently, the normal queue had a bit of a wait though). Went for a bite to eat and by the end was already 4.00pm so with not much time in the park I looked online which rides were the ""unmissable"" ones. Waited for my opportunity to ride Jurassic Park, Revenge of the Mummy and Battlestar Galactica. Was almost 5pm when I rode in order The Mummy (15mins wait), Jurassic Park (20m wait), Battlestar Galactica (15m cylon, 30m human). Of these, Jurassic park was probably the least worthy of a wait. Spent the ride spinning round anxious I'd start to feel naseous, only for a couple of semi-exciting drops before the ride end. <br /><br />Obviously, given more time we would have tried to experience a few shows as well but with a big family including children it was difficult to make it for the specific times. We did catch the trolls show which is cleverly scheduled as the last show of the day and located at the exit of the park. <br /><br />I was surprised by the lack of queues at the rides and dismissed it as the period possibly being low season. It could also be that I queued so late in the day. Luckily, didn't purchase the express pass. I would have been livid. I imagine if we entered at park opening the queues would have been much longer but by an hour before closing most people were exhausted and had already left.<br /><br />If you're going to Singapore, honestly there's not a huge number of other things to do so Universal is worth the visit. It's a bit pricey but you've decided to visit Singapore so trying to save money is already out of the window. On the flip side, it's not something that I would visit Singapore just to visit though. It doesn't reach the scale of a Disney World or Universal Florida.","Family","0","","Written June 10, 2024","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

However, this visual appeal is overshadowed by a glaring issue: the pervasive lack of adequate information regarding its events and attractions.<br /><br />Yet, despite the allure of its setting, the park falls short in communicating vital information to its patrons, particularly concerning its events and attractions. This deficiency becomes painfully evident upon entering the park, as visitors are confronted with a plethora of high-level rides and attractions without prior knowledge or understanding. This lack of pre-visit information undermines the visitor experience and potentially leads to disappointment and frustration.<br /><br />The absence of comprehensive event details prior to entry represents a significant oversight on the part of Universal Studios Singapore's management. Prospective guests are left uninformed about the nature of the park's offerings, including the intensity of rides, age suitability, and any potential restrictions or advisories. This not only hampers visitors' ability to make informed decisions but also poses safety concerns, particularly for families with young children or individuals with medical conditions.<br /><br />Furthermore, the lack of upfront information can result in an unpleasant surprise for guests upon discovering that certain attractions may not align with their preferences or physical capabilities. This creates a sense of disillusionment and detracts from the overall enjoyment of the park experience.<br /><br />Moreover, the absence of pre-visit event information undermines the value proposition for guests. Without prior knowledge of what to expect, visitors may question the justification for the steep entry fees associated with Universal Studios Singapore. A transparent and informative approach to communicating event details would not only enhance the visitor experience but also foster a sense of trust and goodwill towards the park.<br /><br />In conclusion, while Universal Studios Singapore undoubtedly excels in providing a visually stunning and immersive environment, its failure to adequately inform guests about its events and attractions represents a significant shortcoming. The lack of pre-visit information detracts from the overall visitor experience, undermines safety considerations, and diminishes the value proposition for patrons. Addressing this issue is imperative for Universal Studios Singapore to fulfill its potential as a premier destination for entertainment and leisure.","Family","0","","Written April 18, 2024","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

As the day went on there were some longer queues but maximum we waited was 20 mins and then for some rides we went as single riders - also recommend this if kids are brave, as it massively cuts down wait time.

It ISN'T a big park, but even so, we spent about 8 hours here and managed to do all of the rides. <br /><br />We had an early entry so convinced the family to get up and spent 15 SGD on a ride from our hotel (Sofitel) . We were in seamlessly by 09h30 so raced up to do the popular rides (river rapids and the Mummy). Having bought express passes, I was worried that I might have wasted money as the park was very quiet so we were whizzing through the rides. However, by 11h00 queues had started to build and by 13h00 the biggest rides had 60 min waiting times. I can't imagine how busy this would be during school hols.<br /><br />My advice - get there early, do as many rides as you can. Take a break and then use your express pass to have a second go. See the Waterworld show, it is good, silly fun and you get a sit down. It is SO hot, so you can't race about from ride to ride. Take it easy and hydrate!<br /><br />The place is super, super clean and there were decent food options and I didn't feel as gouged as I have done at the Disney parks in the US.","Family","0","","Written April 13, 2024","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

However, this visual appeal is overshadowed by a glaring issue: the pervasive lack of adequate information regarding its events and attractions.<br /><br />Yet, despite the allure of its setting, the park falls short in communicating vital information to its patrons, particularly concerning its events and attractions. This deficiency becomes painfully evident upon entering the park, as visitors are confronted with a plethora of high-level rides and attractions without prior knowledge or understanding. This lack of pre-visit information undermines the visitor experience and potentially leads to disappointment and frustration.<br /><br />The absence of comprehensive event details prior to entry represents a significant oversight on the part of Universal Studios Singapore's management. Prospective guests are left uninformed about the nature of the park's offerings, including the intensity of rides, age suitability, and any potential restrictions or advisories. This not only hampers visitors' ability to make informed decisions but also poses safety concerns, particularly for families with young children or individuals with medical conditions.<br /><br />Furthermore, the lack of upfront information can result in an unpleasant surprise for guests upon discovering that certain attractions may not align with their preferences or physical capabilities. This creates a sense of disillusionment and detracts from the overall enjoyment of the park experience.<br /><br />Moreover, the absence of pre-visit event information undermines the value proposition for guests. Without prior knowledge of what to expect, visitors may question the justification for the steep entry fees associated with Universal Studios Singapore. A transparent and informative approach to communicating event details would not only enhance the visitor experience but also foster a sense of trust and goodwill towards the park.<br /><br />In conclusion, while Universal Studios Singapore undoubtedly excels in providing a visually stunning and immersive environment, its failure to adequately inform guests about its events and attractions represents a significant shortcoming. The lack of pre-visit information detracts from the overall visitor experience, undermines safety considerations, and diminishes the value proposition for patrons. Addressing this issue is imperative for Universal Studios Singapore to fulfill its potential as a premier destination for entertainment and leisure.","Family","0","","Written April 18, 2024","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

We had tickets that allowed early entry and we went on a weekend. I defiantly recommend early entry as it meant we got to do 2 rides with zero queue and then went straight for the galáctica rides as soon as it was 10 so also go to ride these with zero queue - so no need for fast pass. As the day went on there were some longer queues but maximum we waited was 20 mins and then for some rides we went as single riders - also recommend this if kids are brave, as it massively cuts down wait time. We also really enjoyed the food and some of the street entertainment.","Family","0","","Written April 14, 2024","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

It ISN'T a big park, but even so, we spent about 8 hours here and managed to do all of the rides. <br /><br />We had an early entry so convinced the family to get up and spent 15 SGD on a ride from our hotel (Sofitel) . We were in seamlessly by 09h30 so raced up to do the popular rides (river rapids and the Mummy). Having bought express passes, I was worried that I might have wasted money as the park was very quiet so we were whizzing through the rides. However, by 11h00 queues had started to build and by 13h00 the biggest rides had 60 min waiting times. I can't imagine how busy this would be during school hols.<br /><br />My advice - get there early, do as many rides as you can. Take a break and then use your express pass to have a second go. See the Waterworld show, it is good, silly fun and you get a sit down. It is SO hot, so you can't race about from ride to ride. Take it easy and hydrate!<br /><br />The place is super, super clean and there were decent food options and I didn't feel as gouged as I have done at the Disney parks in the US.","Family","0","","Written April 13, 2024","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

It's definitely an experience for my family who like theme parks and films.  You can easily spend one full day here and not feel bored  Big range of activities for kids and adults.  Also a number of great attractions and side activities.

The park is small but has very good attractions like the roller coasters, some look like those in Orlando but others don't, we arrived an hour early and managed to get on all the attractions and ride the roller coasters 2 or 3 times each. I recommend going during the week and not during school vacation time because really with a lot of people the story must be completely different due to the heat and even more so because the attractions that are most crowded you have to leave your things in a locker that is free only for a period limited time. In our case, the longest line we had was 15 minutes, so it was wonderful.<br /><br />The food inside is expensive so I recommend bringing something to eat and you can refill your water bottle there. The only thing I didn't like was that they were closing the Madagascar area because it was what made it different from the other parks in Orlando and also one of the ones we wanted to see the most. They made one of my favorite villains there just like in Orlando that opens this year, but I would have liked to see Madagascar.<br /><br />Don't miss the Waterland show, very good.","Friends","0","","Written March 10, 2024","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

But, we all know that - right.  So go in with the expectation that it is smaller, and enjoy it for what it is.  In comparison it is no different as per wait times etc.  It was not overly busy when we went but most good rides had a wait time of 1 hour plus - but the roller coaster is worth the wait .... loved it.  I also love the fact that there is free lockers, to place your items in before going on the roller coaster.  I am a little over done with Waterworld ""Universal - time to change this up""!  Why 3 stars - well this universal does not have any ""parades"", nor are there many characters walking around for photo opportunities.  I only saw Kung Fu Panda, about 3 times - nothing much else.  Also, very boring characters in the stores for purchase.  My 4D Shrek seat was broken, so did not get the full experience of a packed cinema.  The toilets where not always the cleanest.

I purchased the special festive tickets ahead of our holiday which included a regular day ticket, meal deal and S$5 retail voucher. We travelled there via the Cable Car from Harbourfront (where our cruise ship was docked) although we realised  after the journey that it wasn't the easiest way to get to Universal Studios and certainly wasn't the cheapest travel option. Recommended route would be the MRT or walking via the boardwalk.<br /><br />There are six zones in the park and each one houses a small handful of rides and attractions...there are six roller coasters in total (which was my main reason for visiting) and the biggest was Battlestar Galactica (which is actually two separate roller coasters that interact with each other - Human and Cyclon). Cyclon is an intense inverted coaster with five inversions, and Human is a conventional roller coaster and more family-friendly, although both tracks feature a launched lifthill which gives a great punch to the start of the ride).<br /><br />The other 'big' roller coaster is Revenge of the Mummy - an enclosed coaster which features three launches and a dark ride section. Rode this a couple of times as the queue was short. The remaining coasters are more family friendly...Canopy Flyer and Puss in Boots are both suspended coasters that hang under the track and Enchanted Airways is a fun compact steel family coaster. As well as the roller coasters, I must mention the excellent Transformers The Ride 3D attraction and the fun family friendly Sesame Street Spaghetti Space Chase ride. We also enjoyed the Shrek 4D theatre, which was the same as one we had done elsewhere but a lot of laughs.<br /><br />It plans to think ahead in terms of ride order, as we found the big rides and roller coasters were quiet first thing (short queues between 5 and 20 minutes) and also later in the day the queues were short, but in contrast, an hour after park opening most of the big rides had queues of around an hour or so. We also visited on a Thursday which was reasonably quiet compared to peak days and weekends. <br /><br />Some of the rides had single rider queues (SRQ) to ensure the trains went out without empty seats although on Canopy Flyer the SRQ was roped off and the staff told me it was closed so I gave up attempting to ride it again as the queue was 50 minutes. The park also do not permit any on-ride photography on the roller coasters, even with secured GoPro cameras on official harnesses. This isn't a safety issue and secured GoPro cameras are permitted at many parks around the works such as Busch Gardens and SeaWorld parks. The Battlestar Galactica coaster also has x-ray machines at the entrance and staff using paddles to check you have no cameras in your pockets, which is totally understandable for loose articles but annoying when the GoPro cameras are secured and totally safe. <br /><br />Overall we had a great day, rode all the attractions and roller coasters that we wanted to ride, and enjoyed our festive meal deal lunch. The park is flat and easy to navigate, has plenty of shady areas, although not a massive number of places to sit down near the coasters. The theming is top quality as you would expect from Universal. Highly recommended.","Couples","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/2b/50/b0/25/caption.jpg

After we're kicked out, we saw a family just came and immediately take a picture with Shrek and Fiona (and we ask to staff they came with Universal Express). My kids just ask why can't we take a picture with Shrek and Fiona, but the other family can.

As a tourist experience though, you'll be hard-pressed to have a good time, and you'll feel robbed given how much it costs. Simply put - they let too many people in at a time. I waited 1-2 hours for rides, and it just kills any fun you're planning on having (especially when some of the rides go for less than one minute). They have expensive 'express passes', but these are kinda classist rubbish and undermine the whole concept of queuing in the first place.  <br /><br />I think the Jurassic Park rapids ride is one of the best, but bring spare shoes and clothes because you will get soaked. I also enjoyed 'Lights, Camera, Action', and the Waterworld show. <br /><br />Despite the high entry cost, the park has several microtransactions; $5 to borrow a poncho, $5 to use a drying pod, etc. Feels pretty greedy given how much you pay to enter the park. <br /><br />One thing to check is the weather forecast - any lightning at all and they'll close all the outdoor rides. Good luck doing anything indoors - once the outdoor areas were closed, all the indoors activities had queues stretching out into the pathways and there were no seats to be found at any of the cafes. They won't give you any return passes or refunds, and Singapore is a tropical area where this happens pretty regularly... <br /><br />Long story short - only worth your while if you're sure that there are minimal crowds.

The reasons for taking the VIP tour were as follows:<br />1. My father had a health issue that made walking/ standing at length a problem.<br />2. I wanted my parents to enjoy the rides with my kids<br />3. We had come during the Christmas week & place would be super crowded.<br />4. The resorts at Sentosa were priced very high making even a 2 day stay prohibitvely expensive.<br /><br />The best compromise was a VIP Tour & Joan who was our guide deftly handled the way to cover the entire park in under 6 hours ( 5 hrs + 1 hr lunch break)<br /><br />The VIP pass entitles you to get a free buggy for the kid(s) & an e-scooter at 50% discount , which we availed .<br /><br />We were at the VIP lounge @ 10am. Our tour started at 11. Used the hour to freshen up...drink some coffee served & getting anxious looking at all the crowd passing by us thinking that we will have to be in some amount of queues....<br /><br />None of that happened....Joan took us to the rides with wait time = 0 & direct lifts to rides so that my dad didnt have to use stairs...We covered almost 10 rides & 4 shows in that period which is impossible even with an express pass. Seats with best views at shows were blocked & lines were avoided making the whole experience an absolute worth the 430 SGD/ ticket that was paid for super peak times.<br /><br />Photo opportunity were made exclusively / first in line for us which made the kids super excited. <br /><br />I would suggest anyone with a limited time frame to use the VIP pass. The other advantage is that after the tour gets over , you can continue to use the VIP pass as an express ticket too. So yes, the rides can be taken for the 2nd time but after the tour is over with a little wait depending upon the crowd. <br /><br />The VIP pass also has a 25 SGD food voucher, which has to be redeemed completely. no refunds for any change left over is given.","Family","0","","Written January 2, 2024","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

The park was overcrowded, forcing us to endure excruciating two-hour waits for certain rides. To salvage our experience, we had to shell out more money for the Universal Express pass, only to find it granted us a single ride per purchase.<br /><br />The culinary offerings further added to our frustration – overpriced, meager portions, and poor quality left us questioning the value. It was disheartening when the most reasonably priced item was a simple beer. All in all, an expensive endeavor for a subpar experience.<br /><br />I would not recommend if you want to keep your sanity.","Family","0","","Written December 28, 2023","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

You can catch a cable car here, use the monorail, or even a bus. <br /><br />Even with a pre-booked ticket, I would suggest you get here slightly earlier than opening time to a get a place in the queue and get a jump over other visitors. The park isn’t as large as the American version in LA or Orlando but you still need to plan accordingly. I also suggest downloading the app before you get there as it will have the map on it as well as wait times for each ride. Don’t take the wait times as gospel though as it can be wrong as one ride I checked was as low as 5 minutes when it showed as 50 minutes at the ride. It is generally reliable though.<br /><br />The park is broken down by themes and there were lots of rides that are suitable for young and old as well as the more adventurous. There were not as many single rider queues as I thought there would be as I don’t really enjoy roller coasters whereas my sister loves them. I really enjoyed the 3D/4D rides the best. Shrek 4D was fun but Transformers The Ride was the best that we rode that a few times. I enjoyed the live show of Waterworld. Word of warning is that you will get wet if you sit in the splash zones. Another place where you will get drenched is the Jurassic Park Rapids Adventure. It is the luck of the draw if only your shoes get wet or you get a total soaking!<br /><br />Lots of places to grab a bite to eat or drink. Plenty of places to buy souvenirs. There were a few places you can get pictures with the characters but didn’t really have time for that. <br /><br />The park may not be the largest but we spent the whole day here so you need to manage your queuing time. We didn’t eat anything here (which helped saved costs) nor did we buy any souvenirs. Just bought drinks to stay hydrated as it does get hot so make sure get shade by doing indoor rides or shows and avoid any rain in there too. We managed to do our favourite rides a few times but you just focus on rides and shows you can squeeze in each one once if the queuing gods are on your side.<br /><br />Worth doing and nice way to spend time outside of Orchard Road and shopping.<br /><br />","Family","0","","Written December 28, 2023","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

Childs didn't enjoy it and got frustrated.<br /><br />The worst and most traumatic moment was when the staff rejected my daughter (with a special needs condition) in the last session of the Madagascar meet & greet. I begged so hard, for only 1 photo for her, but he rejected it with bad words.

I was quite interested to try out USS, due to the unique attractions it offers but also some more familiar. The Mummy is an exceptional ride and just as great here in Singapore as when I first rode it in Florida in 2006. Nice to re-live the memories. The Shrek area is well themed with enjoyable rides. Jurassic Park feels a little more limited than the Florida version but its different enough to make it worth trying. Battlestar Galactica and Transformers are also great rides too. <br /><br />Was I nervous about visiting USS after reading the reviews on here? Absolutely. You must plan ahead and must be prepared to do things differently. I downloaded the USS app weeks in advance to monitor queue patterns on different days. What did this tell me? Well, most people do the first ride they see near the entrance, pushing queue times up to 90+ minutes within the first half an hour of opening. So we walked to the other end of the park (doesn't take long, it's a small theme park) and managed to do 5 rides within the first 45 minutes. We went back to Transformers near the entrance later in the day as it became quieter due to the morning rush making it's way to Puss in Boots by mid afternoon. <br /><br />So, top tips if you want to have a great time; <br />1. Get there at opening time, they even let you in before the posted opening time, so you can get to your first ride bang on time<br />2. Don't waste time with selfies etc at the entrance, do that later if you must. <br />3. Go to the furthest end of the theme park and start with those rides.<br />4. Go on a weekday. <br /><br />If you follow the above tips, chances are you won't need an Express Pass. We bought one based on the negative reviews here and only used it towards the end of the day to squeeze in as many rides as possible. Our final tally was 21 rides in 7 hours (4 times on the Mummy!).  We had a great day for rides. <br /><br />Finally, I've scored 4 stars instead of 5 ... well, the food at Friars in the Shrek area was pretty bad. The only negative in an otherwise great day.

There are only about 15 rides (inclusive of children's rides) in the park as such the queue for each ride was huge. The avg waiting time for each ride was about 1 hour for general tickets (about 5k INR) and 20 min for people with express pass (about 10k INR). The ride time was between 40 seconds to 3 min max. So you wait about 1 hour for a minute long ride which was crazy and exhausting. Then at around 5:30 pm they started forcing people out of the park (yes, they wouldn't  allow you to even rest or pose for a photo) because they had another event in the same park from 6 pm called the Halloween's night or something similar for which they had sold tickets separately. So the focus was all on money and zero on visitor satisfaction, unlike the rest of singapore.

With an open time of 10am, that gives visitors theoretically an absolute maximum 7 hours to achieve everything they wanted to do. That's assuming visitors turn up right as gates open and leave right as gates close. And we haven't even considered waiting in the long queues, time for eating/resting, souvenier shopping, ride delays from adverse weather etc. It's simply not enough time (especially without the pricey express pass).<br /><br />Given the price of admission, a longer time should be provided to visitors to utilise the park.

Accessible by public transport, taxi, car, bus, monorail, cable car, it is easy to get there from anywhere in Singapore.<br /><br />Entrance costs $82, to which add the price of an unlimited express pass ($110) or an attraction express pass.< (not obligatory). The amusement park is divided into several themed zones, Jurassic park, very distant, Waterworld, Sesame Street, futuristic zone, the mummy zone, etc.<br />Everything is very well themed, we are really immersed in the universe of each zone. The park is very clean and well maintained. There is something for everyone when it comes to attractions.<br /><br />The park is not very big, you can get around it quickly, unfortunately. We went there in the middle of August, without the unlimited pass we would not have enjoyed the attractions as much (2 to 3 hours of waiting for some). With the unlimited pass, we were able to enjoy certain attractions 3 to 4 times in a row. Of course, the price of the pass is more expensive than the entrance but it is really effective. Again, if you can afford it and want to enjoy your day without frustration, the pass is necessary. No more than 15 minutes of waiting.<br /><br />Street shows are offered throughout the day, it is possible to meet the characters and take photos with them. The attractions do their job, the adrenaline is there. Special mention for the Jurassic Park attraction and live action by Spielberg.<br /><br />Possibility of eating at different points of sale even if not everything was open. The Transformers attraction was closed.<br /><br />Negative points :<br />- you have to queue again, once the entry ticket has been scanned, to collect the bracelet linked to the pass purchased, it's a shame. There should be another system because you can quickly wait more than 30 minutes.<br />- The opening hours are a bit limited (11 a.m. to 6 p.m.) for a park of this type.<br /><br />We had a very good day.","Couples","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/2a/93/c5/d5/caption.jpg

Yati even managed to get us an air conditioned box for the Waterworld show which was an extremely welcome break from the heat. I have been to Florida and Hollywood versions of Universal and the only improvement I think they could make to this VIP ticket is to ensure that people with them can have priority access to all rides even when not with their tour guide. You can go in the express line but not all rides have those so you would have to queue up with everyone else. For the money I think express on all rides should be a thing. Having said that, we barely had time to go on anything at the end of the tour as it was such a packed day so it wasn't the end of the world and Yati was the perfect host for the day, making it really special for all of us.

Many rides are closed and lines are long. Not many options for young kids and character entertainment is also met with long lines. Food is terrible! Extremely disappointing to experience the park closing at 5 (website says 7) with no prior notice of that. Because of this there was many experiences and we were unable to get to. Buying tickets was also difficult and unfortunately no express passes available. <br />Over all I would recommend it for families.

I think if you have ever visited the American ones, this is mandatory to avoid disappointment. If you haven't visited the parks in the U.S., I think it is easier to totally enjoy this one.<br /><br />I was a bit afraid of the long queues, since most reviewers wrote about that but I was super lucky and basically never had to wait in line except for once when I had to wait for 40 minutes to go on the Jurassic Park river attraction, which is totally okay. It was a Thursday and I skipped the sci-fi part because I can't do those attractions for health reasons, but when I walked passed them I saw there weren't really long queues (just in case, there is the pass to skip the queues but, of course, it is pretty expensive and I didn't buy it).<br /><br />The staff generally speaks good English. Some staff members are really nice while others average or not too much in the mood for a theme park. The attractions were okay (Shrek 4 and the Pantages theatre were closed, they told me about which attractions would be closed when I redeemed my ticket from GetYourGuide and they also said in case of rain all outdoor attractions would shut down). The Jurassic Park rapids are not even close to those in America but they are nice. I can say the majority of the attractions were okay, nothing really cool. I had the feeling like the whole park was just pretending. I mean, I know Minions and Jurassic Park's dinosaurs etc. are not real, but I am paying to believe they are. Also, for being a theme park about movies, the only attraction which tackles the topic (like how movies are filmed etc.) is the one narrated by Steven Spielberg, which was nice, but I think putting (fake, of course) handprints on the ground to resemble the Walk of Fame or the sign ""Hollywood"" is not enough to make people believe the park has something to do with the movie industry.<br /><br />The park looked a little run down, as I said, like they didn't make much effort to create locations and rides which looked intriguing and as if you'd actually ended up inside Jurassic Park or whatever. I didn't like the shows much as well. Poor acting and it was like the cast members were trying too hard to have fun and to get the audience involved but I have a bit of background in the creative sector and I think the majority of people would enjoy their acts (as it seemed from the crowd). <br /><br />All in all, I'd rate this park 3 out of 5. I think it shouldn't be branded as a Universal Studios one, then it could stand on its own and be okay but the comparison with the others Universal Studios parks is often inevitable and this park reminded me more of an Italian theme park (I am originally from Italy) than a proper, Universal Studios branded park which should be about allowing you to go ""inside"" movies and experience something magical/full of adrenaline.<br /><br />I'd say go if, like me, you don't have expectations and you're in the mood for an easy day out, as when you go to the fair. If you have young kids, I think they will love it. The prices for drinks and foods are high, I only bought an ice-cream and then ate and drank the things I brought along (nobody checked that). Super easy to get there from Singapore's centre.","Solo","0","","Written September 16, 2023","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

I liked the themed zones with nice variety. The “Express Pass” was a great idea since I am here for a few days only. The park was so easy to navigate and stroll around. Food was great too, I had a mid-day snack of vegetarian Punjabi samosas from OASIS SPICE CAFÉ, the samosas were large and tasty. Later, I had a late lunch of vegetarian noodles with vegetable spring rolls from FRIAR’S GOOD FOOD, the noodles were well cooked and very tasty too.

We especially liked Mummy the ride. Unfortunately Transformers ride was closed for maintenance for the whole day. We went to the park on Thursday, outside of any Singapore holidays, but queues were still pretty long during the day, 30-60 minutes (even on some family rides). There are two reasons in my opinion:<br />Firstly staff were really slow, especially at Battlestar Galactica.<br />Secondly, the park's policy seems to be pushing fast track tickets. Sometimes they filled up the entire train with fast trackers, sometimes they took only a few people from regular queue, so we waited almost an hour for Human track, despite queue wasn't long.<br />Surprisingly the Cyclon (more intense) track was not much in demand and real waiting time there was about 10-20 minutes throughout the whole day (which we exploited after we found out about it to fulfill riding eagerness).<br />Also the park forces people to use lockers outside of rides to store personal things, instead of leaving them on shelves at the ride platform. They are strict and even scanning everyone with metal detector each time at the Battlestar Galactica.<br />On the other hand, no one was checking whether we are taking out own food or drinks into the park.","Couples","0","","Written September 1, 2023","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

The Jurassic World Movie is old in today's terms with the ride at Orlando released in 2022. This still shows Jurassic Park ride with the movie release being in 1994. Even with the new 2024 minion ride, the park seems quite tired and I came away feeling that I should visit Orlando or Osaka where I can spend my money and get value for the experience.

Unfortunately it is very popular and during the day, you will not be able to do all the attractions, also because the opening hours are very short, 10am-6pm. They don't provide maps of the park, with show times attached, so if you don't have an internet connection to download the app, you're in trouble! The latter works very well, and indicates both show times and waiting times for attractions. In reality they offer a free connection, but after a couple of connections it denies the login and the staff doesn't know how to solve the problem!

We visited on an Monday morning in August and thought it would be relatively quite. Wrong. The place was packed, despite some light rain.

In our case, no interruptions at all. <br />In total, few rollercoaster rides, the “Battleship Galactica” two rides are the most noticeable. It could have worked better if we had known the following:<br />1.  Get the express pass. You definitely need this. When we realized, it was exhausted. <br />2. Move around more in the park, as queues tend to change over time. One of the “Battleship Galactica” rides, that had reached 90 minutes wait time at 13.00, had only 15mins at 15.00 and then increased again.<br />3. Not plan to eat there.

Worst thing in Singapore for tourists and families. Be careful taking elderly here","This is easily the worst theme park I've been to. If you are travelling, I would seruously consider waiting for another countries theme park.<br /><br />So first off, it's pricey. There are not many rides and even when we went in off peak, lines for the basic rides were over 60 minutes. They closed rides down after 2pm as the queues for long enough for closing time<br /><br />If you are going to go, you need that vip pass. It's a pay to play theme park with even the shows taking an hour plus to line up for. Honestly don't bother unless you have a pass to skip the queues. <br /><br />We could only fit in 2 rides with the queues, it's $100 to get in as well. It's not worth doing with the standard pass<br /><br />We waited in line for Jurassic world 90 mins when the wait time on the app says 50. The reason this happened is they block of the ride for the line jumpers. I was counting around 6 rafts at a time had no people from the normal line in it. So add another 50% time to what they say the wait times are.<br /><br />Half the water fountains don't work, that's rough when it's 36 degrees. Lined up over an hour, so thirsty and the water fountain was not far off. But it's broken so that's too bad.<br /><br />If you are elderly or want to bring elderly along, re think and check the weather. With a serious lack of water facilities working, monster queues of 30 min to buy drinks and not much shade or rest spots, this could turn into a serious situation quick. <br /><br />The final thing I saw that just made me I'll was a man who absolutely slapped the hell out of his daughter. I'm not sure where discipline and assualt change in this country, but that assault on a child was disgraceful. It would've thrown me off balance and I'm not a small man.<br /><br />No way you can call a place like this family friendly when this behaviour is allowed. Surely there is a way to implement a non violent disciplinary legislation in the park. I get that smacks and punishment are allowed here, but it's not like that in every country. A child seeing another getting absolutely flogged like what I saw at Universal is sickening and can't be good for them. Not here to get angry about discipline, but it can be taken to far like what I saw. <br /><br />My opinion is to skip the park, it's easily the worst experience of Singapore so far.","Couples","0","","Written August 20, 2023","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

The day came closer and closer and the kids were thrilled to go. That day around 12pm (we visited the Sea Aquarium first) we arrived at USS and everything went smooth at the entrance. We decided to rent a stroller for the kids. There were about 5 customers in front of us and it took about a total of 45(!) minutes queueing in the heat before it was our turn. Way too long for just a stroller rental place. <br /><br />Finally we could start our USS trip, it was a weekday (Wednesday) and it was sooo crowded and there were queues everywhere. The estimating waiting times were from 60 minutes for the simple rides to 120(!) minutes for the rollercoasters. This is absolute crazy, queueing that long for a 3 minute ride. <br /><br />We decided to give it a shot anyways and started to queue at the Dino Soarin (Jurassic World). After about 45 minutes, we were about halfway the queue. The kids lost their patience and we decided to leave the queue. We went through the park for about an other 30 minutes, but there were queues everywhere, therefore we decided to leave the park. It was absolutely a waste of money. I recommend not to go here, since you won’t be able to ride the rides unless you have very much patient (even with an Express ticket).<br /><br />We were planning to visit Universal Studios in Osaka next year, but after reading the reviews of that park regarding the queueing times they are not much different from the one in Singapore so we decided that’s also a no-go.","Family","0","","Written August 20, 2023","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

Unlike other parts of the world where you can tell they are happy and welcoming, here they have the same intensions but they show it differently.<br /><br />(2) Most rides are nice, old, but nice and brings back memories.<br /><br />(3) We chose the day with the least possibility of rain, and the park was running smoothly that day without rain. If it rains then your day is cut short.<br /><br />(4) It is best to go early to the park to enjoy the stores and take pictures of the nice views before the park opens. Once the park opens, you will utilize that time for the parks, shows and activities.<br /><br />(5) You need to book your tickets in advance, you can’t just walk to the park and buy tickets there. You have to choose a specific date and number of visitors.<br /><br />The Negatives<br /><br />(1) I wanted to take pictures with my family using both my phone and the Park’s staff cameras, unfortunately they insist on using your phone the wrong way and make the picture no looking good and insisted on it so you would have to buy their photo.

We had just one day to visit and so were wary of both queues and prices but also weather! We booked Express Passes in advance, having read the helpful Tripadvisor reviews. Whilst they were expensive, they were really worth it, given the lengthy wait times for certain rides (upto 3hrs), so I would absolutely recommend this, if you can afford it. On the issue of price, it's a theme park after all and so paying ridiculous amounts of money for food, drinks and gift shop items goes with the territory. Yes, you are going to be haemorrhaging money throughout your day but that's what you sign up for - I don't think it's possible to visit these places (incl Disney etc) on the cheap.<br /><br />The rides themselves are fun. Most things were working. Staff were fine - not wonderful nor dreadful. Don't think you need more than a day, provided you get on all the rides you want. Having done it, I don't think we'll need to visit again.<br /><br />I totally understand the recent poor reviews - expensive, too much queueing etc. Having to wait for hours in the Singapore heat for a 2-minute ride would test the patience of any of us. My advice would be - get those express passes and book them in advance - don't wait for the day you visit as they're likely to sell out.  Most people will only visit USS once and so some planning/budgeting beforehand is really worthwhile.","Family","0","","Written August 10, 2023","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

We were there for 3.5 hours and all but about 20 minutes was spent standing in queues in the heat. We felt terrible for the kids and can’t believe we spent so much money on what was nothing but a frustrating and uncomfortable experience. I’m not a natural cynic but this just seems like a blatant money making scheme as if every ride has a minimum of 40 minutes wait (some up to 2 hours!!) surely there are too many people in the park for anyone to get any value out of their ticket price? We would have spent a further ?$200 for the express pass, just to give our kids a more fun experience - but they were sold out (at 12.30pm, park opens at 11am). So disappointing. I will never go back and would discourage anyone from going. Not worth the cost. ","Family","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/2a/01/30/51/caption.jpg

However the entry price was still the same. We spent the day queuing queuing queuing! Queuing for rides for over an hour, queuing for food, it was terrible. We didn’t even get to ride once on each ride. I observed those who purchased the more expensive “jump the queue” ticket and even they were queuing for a long time.  It was a total overpriced waste of money! Due to the ridiculous queues, the fairest thing would be to just charge on a per ride basis, but I guess they would go out of business quickly.

Las sacamos para el día siguiente, y al ver que el pase Express multiplicaba por dos el precio de la nada barata entrada, decidimos no comprarlo, y confiar en que no hubiera muchas colas al ser día de diario. Nos descargamos la app y estuvimos en la puerta a las 10:30 am, media hora antes de la apertura. ¡Había más gente que en la guerra! El día que nosotros estuvimos hubo colas de 120 minutos en algunas horas centrales del día. Nosotros íbamos mirando en la app los tiempos de espera, y logramos no hacer más de 70 minutos de cola (que ya es, porque los ratos que no estás con climatización te agotan el triple). Nos encantó la atracción de Transformers, Shreck y la acuática de Jurassic Park. A pesar de no descansar para comer, ni de ver ningún espectáculo, no nos dio tiempo a montar en todo. Alguna atracción, nos pareció demasiado corta. El horario es tan escueto, solo de 11 a 18 horas, y efectivamente, aunque no es un gran parque no te da tiempo a disfrutar de todo por las colas.<br />En conclusión, si se quiere disfrutar de este parque se hace obligatorio el pase express (mira que a mí me fastidia que según lo que pagues haya visitantes de primera y de segunda). Universal debería ampliar horario, tener más espectáculos y manejar el tema de las colas, ya que nuestra visita nos dejó un sabor agridulce.<br />Ahora, también he de decir que tiene algunas atracciones absolutamente ESPECTACULARES, y las tiendas son preciosísimas. <br />En conclusión, o compras el pase express o vas a experimentar lo que es tener que elegir en qué te montas y en qué no. Este parque tiene algunos puntos muy fuertes, pero  también algunas deficiencias muy notables para estar en la organizada y avanzada Singapur.","","0","","Written July 28, 2023","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

However, our teen son wanted to see what US Singapore is like or has to offer.  The opening time of 11am to until 6pm alone is a deal breaker for me.  As a theme park hopper myself, I know that's really not a lot of time to explore a theme park.  Worst, when we got inside, the wait time for the all rides were 1-3 hours!  How are we supposed to really get the most out of this park and our money?  So, what my teen did was to simply choose the big rides he wanted to go to.  He chose the MUMMY,  Transformer and The Cyclon vs Human ride (Battlestar Galactica) - which I might add that the Cyclon one was one of the best thrill-rides we've been to (Comparable to Six Flags thrill rides).  It's long, smooth and yeap, you can feel the G's!   I gave up the line on Human ride because it took a long time.  He ended up waiting 3 hours while me and my wife waited for him in the Oasis restaurant.  We had lunch in Oasis and parked ourselves there for the most part (while waiting for our teen).  It's air-conditioned and close to all the rides he wanted to go to.  The food in Oasis are Indian favorites.  They are flavorful and a good change from our usual western and Chinese Fares.  It was a super-hot day when we visited hence it was worth it to buy the refillable souvenir bottles for $14sgd.  To refill it with smoothies was just $5sgd and $3sgd for sodas all over the park.  We also sampled the turkey legs, corn in the cup and churros around the park and it was also delish.  The staff seems stiff... strict or not too friendly.  I am unsure if that is just their culture or am I missing something.  When you do ask them questions however, they will reply helpfully albeit abrupt.  We have travel to many different countries hence we don't let these differences bother us.  There were not rude after all, just not friendly in appearance.  No smile, no small talks, no extras.  Don't take it personally.  We just chucked it off as one of our experiences as a first timer in Singapore.  I believe my teen son had a good time here (even for a short time), esp. with the rides but I know we missed some big ones due to time constraints.  Just not enough time to enjoy the entire park and the rides in one day from 11am to 6pm.  It would be best if they open early, like 9am to 7pm, or better yet, 10am to 10pm.  Maybe a 2-day pass will be best if they continue such short opening time.  Unfortunately, that was not included in our Singapore tour plan.  <br /><br />No regrets but definitely a one-time deal for us.

Despite one section of the park being closed for upgrading, you're still charged the full amount as the operator isn't doing well.<br /><br />Due to the abuse faced by many guests (witnessed it first hand), the staff have a ""pek chek"" (aggravated) attitude and are generally curt and unmotivated.<br /><br />The park is open from 11am-6pm daily, regardless if it's a weekend or weekday. However, halfway through the day, an unannounced power outage grappled the park, leaving only 4/11 attractions open. The staff did exceptionally well... at screwing up organisation and damage control. I witnessed some crew members being rude to park guests when all they asked was ""what's going on?"". A large group of people camped for 2 hours outside Transformers, clogging up the walkway. Other crew members had casual conversations with each other outside their respective attractions as if they were off duty, and some even dismissed complaints/queries from disgruntled guests with a wide grin. <br /><br />Once the power outage was gradually resolved around 4.30-5.30 (just as the park was near closing time), I felt like I had been cheated of my money. ""Ride the Movies"" they said, but they forgot to mention that the movie was ""The Room"".<br /><br />If you are a tourist reading this, DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY! USS is a smear on Singapore's image, and as a local, I don't want you to leave our island with a bad taste in your mouth.

Getting to the park on the cable car from Waterfront MRT was good fun, entering easy with limited queue.  My son is T1 diabetic so we queued to get fast passes as he’s allowed.  Disappointed they only allowed 2 when there were 4 of us visiting - in the UK it’s up to 5.  It had been raining a little, bit of thunder which isn’t unusual for this time of year.  However this meant they had closed the 2 largest rides (Human and Cyborg?) and everyone had moved to the Mummy, which was a 95 minute queue, the express queue no shorter than the normal one.  My sons went through nevertheless, and were out in 30 mins in the express queue.  Then they tried the Human rollercoaster which was a 40 min queue per the digital queue time notice.  One and a half hours later they got out (in the express queue).  This is vey dangerous for diabetics to be queuing for this long and quite stressful for us as parents.  We now couldn’t trust the ride wait time boards and it was about 3pm so we decided to complain and leave.<br /><br />Generally this park has had no investment in years  ( I’ve been 3 times in 2015, 2019 and now 2023 and it’s exactly the same). They are using it to extract as much money as possible without caring at all for the customer experience, possibly before demolishing or redeveloping it I suspect.  Everywhere you look it looks tired and worn - it’s hands down the worst theme park I’ve been to for years now.<br /><br />We demanded a full refund from Guests Services, first they said no refunds but after we demanded to see the manager they agreed it (not seen the money yet though). While we were waitjng to speak to the manager we also noted the poor approach to others too - this would not be tolerated in a European or US theme park.  One woman had lost her children and was told they had no way of making announcements, no protocol for dealing with lost kids and she just had to wait at the exit to spot them!<br /><br />A disaster, spend your day and money elsewhere is my advice, we won’t be returning.","Family","0","","Written July 15, 2023","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

Especially coming straight from Tokyo where their Disney Parks were clean, well organised and with friendly staff. <br /><br />The chaos here starts before you even get there. Some space cadet designed the ""Sentosa Express Monorail"" with only 2 cars! So when you have 10s of thousands of people all trying to get there for the 11am open time (yes, you read that correctly, it's only open for 7 hours), it is very, very crowded and slow. Oh and the 6pm exit is even worse. <br /><br />Then when you get there, forget about an orderly queue to get in. It's every man, woman, child, baby in a pram and invalid for himself. Just push your way to front like everyone else. <br /><br />The Battlestar Galactica rides are awesome, but apart from that there isn't much else. We queued for over an hour for the Puss In Boots, only to almost fall asleep on the ride itself. <br /><br />Plus, unlike Disney Land/See in Tokyo, the lines are boring. Over an hour of just looking at boring walls. Doesn't have the same magic. <br /><br />Finally, to top it off, we waited an hour+ for the Transformers ride, only to get 15 minutes from the ride when it malfunctioned. <br /><br />I won't comment on the food prices, as they're as bad and over priced as anywhere else!","","0","","Written July 13, 2023","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

We lined up in the standard lines early on as sometimes they had no one, but it gets very busy very quickly, especially on the higher adrenaline rides like the gallactica coasters, canopy flyer, mummies and transformers rides, and Jurassic rapids ride.  We loved the Jurassic rapids one and mummies one (indoor dark coaster), but warning you get soaked on the rapids ride, although if you don't want drenched shoes it's better to do first thing as the water builds up over the day in the foot hold.<br />If you rush, you can do all the rides within 3hrs max. You can walk over the bridge to sentosa island or catch the express train. The train was packed, and costs 4SGD return trip, doesn't take too long tho and universal is the first stop.<br />It is a bit expensive overall for the amount of rides, but it filled in a day and we had fun so I think it was worth it. Good for families, as there were a few kids rides we didn't do.","Couples","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/29/a9/01/a8/caption.jpg

The cost was extreme for what we did, no doubt about it, but we enjoyed our day and I think the fact that we were on a big holiday and had bought the tickets months ago meant that we kind of forgot the cost..... <br /><br />Food offerings were not great, and the lines were huge very quickly, but we were choosy about what we did, and got lucky on the Jurrasic Park ride and the line was short (ish) when we got there compared to later in the day. <br /><br />About 1/5 of the park is currently closed for new attractions being built which would help with the lines for the current rides. <br /><br />All in all a good day.","","0","","Written July 4, 2023","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

Many of the attractions were closed and the waiting time for rides was excessive (2 hours). We arrived at 11 am and left at 4 pm.  During this time our kids only managed to go on one ride which lasted for about 5 minutes. After waiting for two hours in another line the ride was then closed. This cost of tickets far exceeded any joy we experienced in this park.  We left disappointed, annoyed and hungry.  The food options are also terrible unless you are happy to line-up at Starbucks.  Basically, unless your lining up there really isn't anything else to do in this park. My advice is do not go!","Family","0","","Written July 3, 2023","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

Many of the possible interesting displays were closed. <br />Over a 4 hour period our teenage grandkids were only able to catch one ride which took over an hour standing in line to get and then there was over 2 hours standing in line for a second ride only to eventually find that all rides within the park were being closed down because of a threatening rain storm. The rides remained closed but the rain never came.<br />Unfortunately this was a very expensive waist of a day.

Стоят они очень дорого.<br />Добрались к парку к открытию и увидели стометровую очередь на вход в парк, но по экспресс билету вход отдельный, быстрый, но мы рано обрадовались, только зашли в парк, и нам пришлось встать в огромную очередь на выдачу браслетов для быстрой очереди.<br />В чем проблема была выдать этот браслет заранее при покупке билетов, непонятно. Наверное специально, чтоб люди не катались а стояли в безтолковых очередях. Там мы часа полтора и потратили.<br />Парк этот маленький, но внутри оказалось сотня тысяч человек. С экспресс билетами из них половина. Дерут такие деньги и запускают в парк столько народу. Совести нет.<br />И с этим экспресс билетом стоянка в очереди занимала от 40 мин до 2 часов.  К обеду мы прокатились только на 2х аттракционах. Потом простояв 30 мин на карусель детских динозавров, только мы уселась на динозавра, подошёл оператор и говорит, выходите, аттракцион закрывается по причине облачности. Хотя даже не было ни одной капли дождя. А облачность в сингапуре всегда. Ребёнок был в бешенстве. Закрылось пол парка.<br />Прошло 1.5 часа. Некоторые аттракционы запустили, но не все.<br />Пришлось заново занимать очередь. Пришло время обеда, за сосиской надо 40 минут стоять, что б заказать, потом ещё 40 чтоб её получить, потом ещё 40 чтоб найти стол и сесть и тут поняли что осталось 2 часа до закрытия, а мы толком ни начнём не покатались. В общем парк этот категорически не рекомендую. Деньги на ветер. Экспресс не помогает. А без него за целый день , может 1 2 горки максимум можно пройти. Совести нет у хозяев парка, запускать такие толпы, и мучить людей в очередях и ещё и горки отключать на весь день, потому что водители облочко низкое.

They really need to add more rollercoasters that interest more people because once finished the adult rides, theres the kiddy rides and most of them arent fun<br />But otherwise my favorite outdoor rollercoaster is the cylon as its full of thrills and the excitement that runs through me when I am on that ride is just too high<br />and of course who can forget the revenge of the mummy ride with the backwards motion and the loops. When i first went on the ride, I didnt know what to expect, the first half of the ride when we look at the different characters in the ride was fun but the actual fun starts when the cart reverses and turns and thats when I knew that this ride is my favorite and it has been my all time favorite from when I was small. In my opinion they should take out the shrek area and replace it with an area full of rollercoasters(indoor and outdoor) maybe add dc comic rollercoasters seen in other parks like joker, superman, batman etc","","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/29/71/9d/a2/taking-a-picture-with.jpg

Note all public busses and trains on the island are free so, pick hotels close to the services.<br /><br />Universal is an impressive park with many attractions but my 13 year old son was only interested in the rides.  We arrived at 11:00am opening and settled on Battle Star Galactica coasters.  <br /><br />We chose the Cylon ride first as it was a hanging coaster, also there were no people queuing. Best decision of the day, got in a few rides with minimal waits.  This one is not for the faint hearted, very aggressive with loops, spirals and ample opportunities to look at sky past your feet.  The Human ride we tried next had a wait time of 30 mins was fun but more tame.  Good for younger kids.<br /><br />The Transformer ride was impressive with 3D effects and movement very well done.  We loved this ride but get ready for a long wait with the queue taking about 40 mins.<br /><br />Food was good but expensive as you would expect with a few food halls to pick from.  Take cold water in a thermos and stay hydrated as it is very hot in June and most of the year.<br /><br />There was a show on in front of the State Building with the Madagascar characters.  Also lots of merchandise stores with the Transformers one having some good T-shirts for my 13yo.","Family","0","","Written June 10, 2023","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

However this was being exploited by certain nationalities who clearly knew one another, so this needs to be policed as it's very annoying.<br />I managed to to enjoy three rides and there are convenient locker storage facilities located near each ride. They are free for certain periods, but some you have to pay for. I never paid and used the free ones only. I didn't use any of the restaurants or shops in the park so I am unable to comment on those.<br />A great day out if you like theme park, only marred by the expensive entry price and queue jumping.","Solo","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/29/57/d7/61/caption.jpg

With opening times from 11am to 6pm we found it was not enough time due to the fact there was a line up to enter to get your tickets scanned once it opened and long lines for rides/attractions of up to wait times of 100minutes.  It was disappointing that the some rides, food stalls, theatres, shows were not running.  We also found that a couple of rides had  ""technical"" issues throughout the day and were unavailable to ride until rectified.<br /><br />With long wait times it is tempting to buy express passes which basically allow you to line up in a shorter line with priority access- (note-there is still a wait!). There are 2 types of passes both priced on top of your entry ticket...one is about S$50 and only allows you to express one time on each of the rides. The other is S$80  and you can go express more than one time. PLEASE NOTE the express passes seem to only permitted on SELECTED rides not ALL. I was also told that only a specific number of express passes are sold per day and the price can increase throughout the day. <br /> <br />The park was understaffed so everywhere was a little chaotic. I would hope that this would improve when its peak season!","","0","","Written May 25, 2023","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

But this is the same w the Universal Studios in Singapore. Not only staff are not nice (cafe - next to the transformers ride) it is the same with the public area cleaner ( I witnessed it next to the Rapids Adventure) as I was waiting for my kids to come back for their ride - a local lady, it was like as if she doesn’t want her job and she was dragging the trash bin and the sweep while saying something in her language in an aggressive manner.<br /><br />The rides, oh well yea- they seemed quite exciting looking after however you need to wait for a minimum of 90 mins per ride which ruins the overall experience. Aside from that occasionally there are technical difficulties that would extend longer your waiting time. For 5H of stay at the theme park, my kids only has 3 rides.<br /><br />The ticket is not cheap. I hope you guys can work on some improvement here.

And I say this having visited Disneyland in HK.<br /><br /> - the timings are ridiculous - 11 am - 6 pm! Are you kidding! With such less time, getting the expensive express pass is almost a mandate. And the express pass does not cover 3 specific rides including The Canopy which has the longest line!<br /><br />- 3 of the rides that we either sat in (mid-way) or were eating to sit in had technical glitches and were delayed by 15-30 mins (when you already have limited time at the park, this doesn't help) . We were in the jurassic park water ride (The Rapids Adventure) when the ride was stopped for about 15-20 mins. We were stuck in the tube in a closed environment - stuffy, hot and claustrophobic.<br /><br />- At least a couple of rides (including the famous puss-in-boots ride) were shutdown for maintenance.<br /><br />- The rides are just about alright, nothing to strike awe.

I purchased a City Go Pass which gave me entry and I decided to upgrade to express unlimited for $220 expecting to be able to get onto rides quicker and with greater regularity. This didn't happen at all. The 2 large roller coasters, had long waits making re attending almost impossible. At times the single riders or the normal queue was quicker than express pass. Several rides were closed;  (the whole of Waterworld, unsure why this area was closed) (Jurassic water ride as they had over sold the express rides, then had a technical fault)  and the other rides in Jurassic world don't take express passes.  Hugely disappointed to have paid a significant amount of money, without the option of using it. The majority of food courts were closed leaving only some popup takeaway options.<br /> I raised this with customer services, who were pleasant but couldn't /wouldn't offer a refund. $110 per ride is very steep. They advised capacity was at its limit today, hence why rides for express pass were closed. If patrons can't use the pass, don't damn well sell it in the first place. That is dishonest. Be upfront and advise the park is hugely busy, ride times will be long and express unlimited isn't  available for the majority of the rides. If  rides/eating and entertainment areas  are closed, tell me before I buy the tickets and let me decide if it is worth a visit. Don't fail to deliver and then not offer a refund.","Friends","0","","Written April 26, 2023","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

When we went, 3 attractions were closed and the water play area was also closed - if we had known this we might not have gone as it added enormously to ride queues.  The wait for the Jurassic Rapids said 60 minutes. We actually ended up queuing for 2 hours (after 90 minutes they finally decided to add more boats. Why they didn’t do this at the 30 minute wait time is beyond comprehension). Most of the rides had a 30 minute or longer wait unless you paid either $70 or $100 SGD extra for skip the queue - with 5 paying customers this was out of the question. Not a lot of food options and food was expensive.

The lines were long to get in upon opening, esp at the Guest Services.  Lots of people just gathered around the entrance (really for no good reason I think, possible some tour groups), a little crowd control could be helpful.  <br />Once we were in, the park was not too crowded but I felt it was at capacity.  It was hot and humid, only wished they had more shady areas.  Only the Transformer gift shop sells fans.  Not many icy drink/food stalls that I saw.  Also wished they had more staff walking around in case guests have questions, because we didn't see any.<br />The rides were up to the standards we think, like the other Universals.  The Revenge of Mummy ride was a little different than the Hollywood one, more thrilling we all thought.  <br />Definitely consider getting the Express Passes on a busy day, otherwise, you won't have time to try all the rides and shows in time, since the park closes so early (6pm!).<br />Water World and another show were closed when we were there.<br />Small park.  We saw construction going on at one end, so looks like they are expanding it.<br />One big negative, food court/stalls have long lines (no one manages it) and food was way overprized and not so delicious, what a let down.","","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/28/d9/b1/a9/caption.jpg","Written April 18, 2023","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

","We went there on a Monday at around 3 pm, it was crowded but we were able to get on most of the rides we wanted to go on.<br /><br />TIPS:<br />1. Get the USS app in which you can see the waiting time for each attraction. The longest wait we had was 20 minutes. We just walked in for Transformers, the Mummy, Shrek 4D, and Jurassic Rapids.<br /><br />Initially Transformers was closed for our visit but upon opening a bubble popped up on its location in the app, hence we were able to get on the ride before the majority of people found out that the rode was open.<br /><br />2. Get your tickets bundled with the Singapore tourist pass (via Klook). By doing this we were able to get our tickets at about 65 SGD versus 83 SGD if you're planning to get just the USS tickets from their website.<br /><br />Negative points of our visit:<br /><br />1. Technical problems in some rides. For the Transformer ride we chose to wait for them to sort out the problem and we were able to go on the ride after less than 15 minutes. We were also not able to get on the Canopy flyer for our entire visit due to technical issues. <br /><br />2. Not much change and less attractions ( Waterworld was closed) as compared to our last visit.<br /><br />3. The hotdog stand near Lights, Camera, Action does not sell hotdogs at the time of our visit.

After I retreat to gave him space he still doesn't care to answer.<br /><br />Same yelling happen when my daughter poses to take photo with puss in boots. <br /><br />I couldn't understand the yelling and scaring little girl when they thought there is some issue. People are going to do some staff that aren't allowed but shouting at your customer can't be the solution. And it is my first time to see these kids of yelling especially in big place like theme park.","Family","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/28/c0/8d/93/universal-studios-singapore.jpg","Written April 8, 2023","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

We went on 3 rides in 6 hours, there was a huge disparity between fast track and normal tickets. A normal queue was 120minutes, where as fast track was 20mins. Very good marketing though - another way to bleed more money out of your wallet. <br />Food courts were closed, so we had to queue for 30 mins to order food and wait another 20mins for it to arrive. <br />Waiting times were inaccurate on the app. <br />Rides were being run by a minimal amount of staff. <br />The place looks shabby and needs an upgrade, they could learn some lessons from their partner in Florida!<br />Save your money and enjoy the cultural side of this amazing city.

I highly recommend purchasing the tickets online. It is much cosier to wait and queue at $82 (Adult Ticket) and $61 (Child Ticket). <br /><br />The Universal Studio is segmented into 6 zones which are The Lost World, including Jurassic Park; Ancient Egypt, including the Mummy; Sci-Fi City, including  Transformer; New York, including Sesame Street, Hollywood, including meeting with the Minion and lastly, Far Far Away, including Shrek and King Julien from Madagascar.<br /><br />The park is relatively small, and compared to Overseas, you can explore all zones when you arrive. Suggested duration - You will be in the USS for over 3 hours.<br /><br />Suggested duration - More than 3 hours.<br /><br />First issue: Waiting time -  expect to wait more than 30 minutes or longer for popular rides.  <br /><br />Second issue: Quality of the rides - if you have seen the latest Universal studio movies, the rides are during the first -release. Such as Shriek in the movie, Transformers. The mummy - when it was the first release. It is not the latest. <br /><br />The cost of the food. It is not justified - it might be cosier than buying the merchandise. <br /><br />Overall, if you are exploring Universal Studio Singapore™  for the first time, you will enjoy your time and the time spent be memorable and fun.","","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/28/b2/3a/e5/part-of-the-theme-park.jpg

The park was quiet (we went on a Thursday outside of SG school holiday) but there were still queues. The UXU passes got us to the front of the line without any wait almost every time. The kids got to enjoy front row seats on all the main rides multiple times throughout the day. And by multiple times I literally mean dozens... something that was only possible thanks to the UXU passes. I know that the cost of the UXU passes makes many question their value, but in hindsight we all agree that having them made the day truly spectacular. And to top it off, the passes also get you through the priority entrance at the front gates too, another bonus! <br /><br />The USS App was very useful for navigating. Strongly recommend that you download. <br /><br />The park is relatively small, and Waterworld remains closed at time of writing, which was sad. But that said, we spend the entire day there and only stopped for lunch! <br /><br />Understanding the locker system and using them efficiently is key to enjoying the day too.  Can get a bit painful. But once you know the rules and get to know where the various banks of lockers are, then it all gets a bit easier. <br /><br />Drink outlets all sell the same, basically coke, lemonade, water and coconut water. Few other options but not much. Don't expect gourmet food, but it was fine, and the kids just wanted to get back to the rides anyway, so that was fine! <br /><br />All in all it was an awesome day out, the kids could not get the smiles off their faces.","","0","","Written March 28, 2023","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

We went as a family of 5 with a pre-teen and a 5 year old. It was a rainy day, but the park was packed anyway. We didn't end up doing many of the rides we wanted to do, as the wait times were 1h for each ride, with only express riders getting on turn after turn. I guess if you are ok forking out the extra 60 SGD per ticket for the express passes, then it could be a great day out, but for 5 people we just couldn't stomach spending another 300 SGD.<br /><br />Second issue: understaffing. Each ride was operated by a single person, which meant that that person would escort everyone out, then let all the riders on, then go around checking that each person is buckled. This process was often longer than the ride itself. <br /><br />Third issue: quality of rides. Some of the attractions were just bad. The Donkey standup comedy was absolutely terrible. The Shrek 4D show had a long prelude to it to summarize the movie. On the Madagascar carousel the attendant just yelled over the mic the entire time about someone not having buckled their seatbelt. Some of the rides were just really short.<br /><br />Fourth issue: the food. 17 SGD for a piece of chicken and a couple of fries. 19 SGD for an ice cream. The food was greasy and really unhealthy. The drinks that came with meals were all sugary soda. ","","0","","Written March 27, 2023","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

Download the app to get the best experience","We had a very lovely time there! I recommend you to download Universal SG app where in addition to park map you can see the food carts and restaurants, shows and the best of all - the time of wait for each ride. When the queue was over 20 minutes we went for another ride and came back when the line was shorter. Of course we went on Monday so there wasn't a big growd anyway (but for example the transformers ride that had at some point 90 minute wait, we only had to wait for 5 when we went). I think it is the best way to really enjoy your time in the park and spend as little as possible waiting for the rides. <br />Of course the park is relatively small so don't expect something like Paris Disneyland. But we went to every ride once (except the rides for children) had a lovely lunch and it took 6-7 hours, so the park isn't small either. <br /><br />One negative aspect to note: You can't take your bag to the ride (as always) but most of the rides don't have a place to put them when you go on, you have to put it in a small locker before you even go to the line. For most of the rides you could use the locker for free for an hour. So you can always find a free one (at first we didn't know that and I paid 4 dollars to keep my little bag there for one ride)","Couples","0","","Written March 26, 2023","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

As a long-time fan of Shrek, I particularly enjoyed the Far Far Away castle and the inclusion of popular songs from the movies.<br /><br />The queues for many of the rides were quite long, although one could get lucky and find shorter lines if a large group had already entered. However, it became apparent that some of the attractions required purchasing the Universal Express add-on to skip the line, as wait times could exceed an hour and a half. Nevertheless, I found the rides and shows to be well worth the wait.<br /><br />As with most ticketed theme parks, the restaurants inside were overpriced for the amount of food provided.

Three times we abandoned queues for rides because they were not moving thanks to all of the spaces being filled up with express pass holders. This really isn't a fair way to operate and there should be a minimum amount of people from the 'normal' line let through for each run. Such an approach is more aligned with fast passes at Disneyland<br /><br />At least half of the shops & food outlets were closed and the ones that were open had queues snaking out the doors.  I get that there is a labor shortage in Singapore but as a global conglomerate, they need to work out a solution to attract more staff. <br /><br />There is not nearly enough shade here. At one point, one of the cleaners could see that my 5 year old was struggling in the heat and went and got her an ice pack. <br /><br />In the end, we gave up and left at about 1:30PM after going on 2 rides and having nothing to eat. Very disappointed as Universal Studios was meant to be the highlight of the trip.","","0","","Written March 14, 2023","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

Decided to do Sentosa Island for a day and go to Universal Studios. It was really fun. Its not that big so only takes aroud 3 - 4 hours, but we didn't go on the roller coasters so that may have taken longer. We had a walk about, went on transformers, mummy and two jurassic park rides. Nice food in Malaysian styke.hawker center just outside main turnstiles by Universal Studios sign that was really nice and cheap too. Went for the express passes too which came in handy, wasn't too busy but if busy they would be even handier to avoid the queues. It was overcast on the day so decides to head back after food to Marina Bay but Sentosa looked really cool. We took the sentosa cable car rouns trip ticket which was cool experience and easy to use and i hear the sentosa express monorail from vivo city near harbour point is just as easy. Travelling around in Singapore was so easy, made the holiday great!","Couples","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/28/6b/de/83/caption.jpg

This isn't because of the smaller size, but rather the fact that it is not managed by Universal. Genting operates the park and they seem to have lower standards in terms of maintenance. Everything here shows its age badly. It has the feel of a Six Flags park much more than a Universal park. If that doesn't bother you too much, they still have a decent collection of rides. Jurassic Park was my favorite as it has an interesting twist on the other JP rides as a rapids ride. The other attractions that should be priorities are Sesame Street, Battlestar Galactica, and Revenge of the Mummy (which is a mirror of Orlando's). The main attractions you can skip are everything in the Shrek area and the Spielberg special effects attraction. The Transformers ride is an exact copy of the others if you have been on those. Unless you are a big theme park fan, this is not a good enough park to carve a day out of your Singapore vacation for. It's not a horrible park, but you should expect Six Flags caliber maintenance with Universal brand rides.","","0","","Written March 3, 2023","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

We were able to finish the entire park riding several rides multiple multiple times. Our 11 year old daughter went on Mummy 3x, Transformers 3x, BG Human 3x, and BG Cylon 5x. There’s no way you can do that waiting in the regular line. What I will say is that US Singapore does a great job of making the express pass worth it—you really do get a much shorter line or no line at all….when we got the express pass at Universal Orlando we felt like it got you a head start but you still had to wait in a pretty long line. Singapore’s version just felt more exclusive. Don’t miss the Shrek 4D experience….it’s like a bonus Shrek movie. <br /><br />Get tix in advance on Klook to save time, and also Klook was more up to date than the official Universal Studios Singapore website when it came to days open. We went on a Tuesday in February. The tickets were available on Klook but NOT available on the official website! Strange but true. <br /><br />After we finished the park, we took a train to Skyline Luge and had more fun.

Well, it's full suite of magic.  I've loved USS for many years because it's been a go-to destination for my daughter who began going at 5 and is now approach 13.  She's loved USS in different ways at different ages.  At this point, USS needs to make a decision - open up entirely, or close down / renovate and re-open with a bang.  Today's visit was a disappointment in that nearly all of the in-person shows have not returned, a few major rides aren't operating, and you can see them cutting cost corners where-ever they can.  the trouble with this is that visitors will not get the full USS experience and not speak as highly as they should.  most of the world has returned full-blast post covid, so USS needs to do the same.  Get everything operational, hire back all staff, and the people will come.  Oh, how bad is it? - well, I found myself several times explaining how the lines and lockers and other things work given no one else was there to explain.  I felt sorry for the tourists.  that said, the remaining staff are stellar - smiles, patience, energy... so, we're close USS - just do it!","","0","","Written February 12, 2023","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

We spoke to a staff in charged, Nick, who was a very energetic, fun and professional photographer, just the kind of energy you would want at a theme park. He explained to us what are the available promotions and which are the best deals we could consider. He also spoke in Chinese which helped my mom understand what are the promotions! so we paid for the package with unlimited soft copies & 3 printed copies. <br /><br />Later that evening when we headed to the photo collection counter, BUT we were told that the system was down and they’re unable to print any of our photos! 😟 We were quite disappointed at first thinking that we won’t be able to get our photos…. There were a bunch of other customers in the photo studio waiting to be told the same bad news but Nick handled the situation well and knew what he was supposed to do. We were told to leave our contact details and that the IT team would solve the issue ASAP. later that evening after about an hour or so, we got our printed copies and all of the soft copies. we were also complimented with two beautiful photo frames and extra printed copies. It really made our trip to USS more memorable with the extra souvenir gifted. 😁 thanks to Nick for approaching us to let us know that there are photo services available and handled the sudden situation like a champ. We are very satisfied with how the issue was resolved. Good Job USS. ✨","Family","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/27/e2/63/dd/caption.jpg","Written January 17, 2023","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

The park has an impressive entrance and covered streets lined with souvenir shops leading you deep in to the park to reach the ride zones. Then the covered areas reduce significantly.<br /><br />Waits for rides varied from 5 minutes (mainly for young children's riders) to 80 minutes in the second week of January. Overall, the park did not feel particularly crowded - well, until it poured with rain for about an hour and then it was difficut to find shelter!  Every available space was crammed with people.<br /><br />In a full day we didn't get through all the rides or zones in the park. One large zone was closed off for the construction of new rides (probably Madagascar themed judging from the man-made trees and ships hull looming over you).  Our teenage children loved the high speed rollercoasters, which keep running even when it is pouring with rain. They only stop for lightening apparently. That can mean that you  queue for an hour for a ride, entering the queue in the sunshine and board a rollercoaster in a tropical downpour. Dress appropriately and carry a rain poncho in your backpack or bag.<br /><br />There are a fair few food venues spread through the complex.<br /><br />However, if you're not into riding rollercoasters there's actually not a lot to do for the price.","","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/27/ce/d1/2e/entrance-to-universal.jpg

Expensive to the point you feel that you are being extorted. Universal Studios Singapore is no exception. Having been before we were keen on fast passes but it would have cost us $1,000 for a family of 4. It was absolutely not worth it. Alas we ended up spending majority of the day queuing up for rides. Thank goodness my kids were patient. Majority of the food outlets were closed which made queueing for what was open absolutely horrendous. There should have been an option for tricker discount given what was not available to the public. <br /><br />Unfortunately the way prices are going here in Singapore, I believe Singapore will shoot itself in the foot and tourism will suffer. Love this country but I doubt my family will be back any time soon.

We enter the theater later and didn't manage to hear the instruction for no lap sitting. When the show started, one of the crew members came with a light baton and told me that my son couldn't on my lap. I completely understand why he shouldn't sit on my lap because the chair moves. I get it.<br /><br />But he wasn't very friendly, to an adult, I can understand, especially after a long day of work and it was very crowded. To someone with a 2.5 yo toddler, I think the attitude was uncalled for. He basically shouted in front of my son. My son was shocked. <br /><br />There wasn't a choice gave to me. He didn't tell me we can move to stationery seats. He insisted for my son to be seated alone when the seats were tilted upward . In the middle of the show, I didn't want to affect the other visitors, I complied with the instruction, tried to put my son on the seat next to me, in a very dark room. Then, the seats dropped and reverted to original position. My son was shocked x2. That's where the nightmare started. My son started to cried non stop.<br /><br />I had no choice but to leave the theater with him. I spoke to the crew outside the theater, then we realized that there were stationary seats. We re-entered but damaged is done. My son cried the moment we step into the theater. I can only hope that he has no phobia of cinema or theater. You can imagine what happened to the rest our day, a much anticipated outing--my son's first and maybe the worst theme park visit. <br /><br />My suggestion to the management. If USS is not meant for small kids, let's inform the visitor upfront. If USS does welcome smaller kids, please train your staff to be patient especially to those with smaller kids. <br /><br />The management should also revisit their procedures to ensure that visitors are briefed. The staff members at the entrance should also remind the visitors who carries toodlers, just in case we miss the announcement.","Family","0","","Written December 27, 2022","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

Before that the USS staff forced us to put all the belongings in the assigned lockers, claiming that the free rental was up to 45 minutes.<br /><br />However at the end we have waited for more than 150 minutes for the game.<br /><br />When we get back to the lockers we were forced to pay S$ 12 to get back the belongings, as the free rental time had passes. Even we feedback to the USS staff on site saying that we had waited for the game far longer than expected which was out of our control but the staff insisted us to pay the lockers fees no matter the reason was.<br /><br />We queued for another attraction “The revenge of Mummy” the waiting time shown at the entrance and the official apps were again as 30 minutes but eventually we have waited for over 80 minutes for the game.<br /><br />Obviously there are a few issues to aware:<br /><br />1.  The waiting time shown at the entrance and official apps is totally inaccurate and misleading:  shown as 30 minutes but eventually waited for 150 minutes and 80 minutes respectively.  I believe they have to let the guests know more accurately the waiting time therefore we have the right to choose wait or not.  To me 30 minutes is reasonable waiting time but if you inform me beforehand the waiting time is more than two hours I will definitely drop it.  This was not a single incident,  it happened to us multiple times in a single visit. Therefore don’t trust their waiting time as shown as they are dishonest and be prepared to wait for double time or more.<br /><br />2.  The free rental time of the lockers is definitely not matching with the waiting time of the corresponding attraction, meaning that the guests are forced to pay for the almost “mandatory rental” lockers (considering even the cell phone have to be placed in the locker, it means the rental is almost mandatory for every guest) which is totally unfair to the guests.  Therefore please prepare to pay extra for the “mandatory” lockers.<br /><br />3.  Some attractions are opening late i.e. 13:00 p.m. while the average waiting time when opened is very long.  During this peak time in Christmas holiday the late opening of some attractions is definitely a trick of the management to force the guests to pay extra money for the express pass.<br /><br />We have been to various theme parks worldwide but our experience in Universal Studio Singapore was definitely the worst in my life, not one of, but the worst.  From the comments of other guests in tripadvisor I learnt that this is not a single incident but it seems that the management did not care about it and just giving a standard “copy and paste” reply here. <br /><br />Therefore please go to any theme park elsewhere but try to avoid Universal Studio Singapore as far as possible, don’t waste your money and more importantly your time.","Family","0","","Written December 23, 2022","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

Decided to have a quick snack at one of the stalls that was open, the prices seemed a bit steep S$19 dollars for a hot dog and a drink, but when you have children you have no choice. Their were only 6 or 7 people in front of me, but I still waited 50 mins to get served, all this time standing in the blazing sun with no shade. Even then I did not get my food, when you do get served you given a remote alarm which will buzz when your food is ready. Had to wait another 20 mins for the food to be available, so basically it is the slowest fast food stall in the world.  <br />All I can say it was very poor all round, would not recommend it, total rip off.","","0","","Written November 28, 2022","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

This was my second time.<br /><br />I feel that USS management needs to know about the service quality and wifi network. Since I havent been to USS for a long time, I needed a map. There was no physical maps but QR code to be scanned. However, network was so bad that I couldnt access the USS app and map. Network was equally bad at the Malaysian foodcourt. I understand USS wanting to go online, but with such bad reception almost everywhere in USS, it becomes a nightmare for the guests.<br /><br />Service staff was the other problem. They all seemed to have left their smiles at home especially the lady (or girl?) manning the customer service where I went to ask if they had a physical map. Totally unhelpful- just kept on saying quite rudely ""we dont have physical maps"" and when I told her I couldnt access the online map as the network was bad, she didnt offer any help but just looked angry and impatient.  Could see  that her face behind the mask was an unhappy one. Best part,  I was the only customer at the counter and this was before 11 am!! <br /><br />The other staff manning the rides also lacked smiles, and made me feel like I was bothering them to go on rides. Noticed they were all quite young.<br /><br />The exception was this elderly staff at the entrance to USS.

We were anticipating for this event for almost 2 years after a halt from covid 19 and this was the worst experience. This was my fifth visit for this HHN event and it was horrible and unpleasant. We were touring around the scare zone to take pictures, when we were approached by this male actor in a robe costume and he directed this comment at me “aiyo why u so short”. I can’t believe that universal studios Singapore would employ such actors to work for such important events that lack of basic professional etiquette and respect for visitors. Such personal remark was uncalled for. My boyfriend and I was shocked and it completely ruined our mood. After arranging our thoughts and emotions we decided to approach the staff and manager. Before we could even point out who the man was, they already knew as they mentioned that this wasn’t the first time he received a complaint. I can’t believe that the management allowed the actor to continue working despite having several complaints! Does universal studios Singapore have lack of staff that they could allow the man to continue working despite such manners and disrespect to their customers ? Your staffs wanted to compensate us for this unpleasant experience. We did not pay 140 bucks to get a personal attack. We did not accept any service recovery compensation as we decided that this event had ruined our moods and we shortly left after. I feel sorry for other people that have this similar experience and I feel that this is not taken lightly. We respect your staffs as we are aware that this job is not easy but we feel disrespected.

I liked the compact nature of the park meaning you didn’t have to walk too far from ride to ride. For anyone unsure I would recommend the express pass, but not the “unlimited” option. For one particular ride there was a snaking queue, however for express pass holders there was literally no queue and we got straight on. I wouldn’t like to attempt to get on the most of the attractions without an express pass. One pretty major issue with the park right now is the lack of eateries. Two of them were closed within a short distance of one another meaning the waiting times for the two that were open was insane. We effectively wasted an hour queuing, finding a seat and eating which wasn’t time well spent. If possible I’d recommend bringing a snack.

","My husband, my 5 year old son and I were there in the first week of October and it had decent crowd. There was Halloween decorations and as well as Halloween parade.<br /><br />Tips:<br />1. Buy Express pass as it saves a lot of time.DO NOT BUY EXPRESS UNLIMITED.  Express pass will give you express access to all the rides + 4 more rides of your choice. I don't think anybody can do more rides than this in a day so no point buying Express unlimited.<br />2. Avoid treasure Hunter ride (Opposite mummy ride). I am not a thrill seeker but this ride is slower than walking. It's out- dated and boring. There was no express line here so we stood there for an hour and it was not at all worth it. I wouldn't go in this even it's free.<br />3. Dont miss- transformers ride. It's not very high thrill but we, as a family found it the best. Though I am not transformers fan.<br />4.You can rent strollers, prams, small electric scooty once inside. I had rented a stroller for my son.

Last visited 2011. It was much fun and staffs were more friendly and energetic. This year not really a good experience. On ground staffs were temperamental and kind of rude. One example was no basic greeting. Demanded for the drink coupons first then can choose which syringe flavours that we wanted. I told her that we have not decided but she still asked for the coupons.  I told her to wait but she said everthing is there. She asked for the coupons again. She thought that I should have known the product. So she took the coupons and then just left us wondering which is which. Bubble gum or blueberry. So I tested her again by asking which one is bubblegum. I gave it a try again because I was not happy with her service. She simply answered yes they were two flavours just take one. So we pretended that we do not know anything. She started to raise her voice and then show it to us what they were. Few others from the staffs at the rides, Universal Studio Shop and Minion Mart. They should be expecting crowd when everything is closed isn't it? But they are the last people that you want to meet. Accomdating? Yes but body language was so bad and obvious. Base on our experience. <br />Was the night scary? Yes. 8/10. <br />Fun? 8/10. <br />Customer service 6/10. <br />Satisfactory 7/10.<br />Lastly you have to plan it well. It depends what is your priority. I suggest you visit all the scary zones and the house of horror. Rides later. You can always come back in the day for it. <br />I do understand that some of us were tired but it is your job to make customers feel welcome and have fun together.

I have seen Japan Disney land so this is nothing like that.<br />I was expecting a lot from Singapore. <br />1. There is no need to book ticket in advance. Based on the weather condition you can book ticket on same day.<br />2. I bought ticket on the spot at physical counter. They have lot of self service counters.<br />3. You will get good high speed service wifi so you can open your mobile and compare online prices with some other websites. <br />4. There will be huge queue in every ride so if your pocket allows buy express ticket. This is like VIP tickets which allows to go straight instead of standing in long queues.<br />This saves lot of time and energy also, because standing in long queues will drain out your energy. <br />5. Take roller coaster, transformer , the mummy and Jurassic park ride first, because these rides are good and as the day passes you will get huge queues.<br />6. Try to reach here by 10.00 am if you want to buy tickets, if already purchased then 10.30am .<br />7. Click photos either early morning once you reach or late evening because during the day you will get huge rush.<br /><br />8. Lot of rides are closed for maintenance so have to enjoy whatever is available.<br />9.

So I was very excited to visit again on Sentosa. <br /><br />It was a few hours of great fun, but I have to say it’s looking run down and tired. A lot of the park’s attractions were clearly the worse for wear. Some shops & attractions were boarded up & a lot were simply closed.The main rides were open and as always were great fun. <br /><br />In fact much was closed, including most of the food options. There were closed rides throughout the park & lots of disappointed fans. <br /><br />But as always the thrill rides made it for me & they are a ton of fun!<br /><br />I’d strongly suggest if like me you are a solo rider (my partner is not a rides guy!) I would avoid paying for the Express Riders pass and use the single riders line every time. I suspect the passes are very much oversold as many of the Express riders seemed to wait for ages and were complaining quite a bit! As a single rider I barely waited at all; there was never a car without a left over single spot.<br /><br />Overall It’s absolutely worth a visit; just don’t go expecting a USA level theme park experience.","Couples","0","","Written October 27, 2022","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

Many rides do not allow kids below 5yrs so plan accordingly, but even with the kids this place is a must watch.<br />On weekend, most of the rides have approx 1 hour long queues so either plan this on weekdays or (my suggestion is) overspend a little here and buy express pass which will allow you to skip the queues. The reason behind my suggestion is weekends are crowded everywhere and and no where else you can prevent crowd from from spoiling them your experience.<br /><br />I will review the rest of it as a Q&A.<br /><br />Q - Is this a must-watch in Singapore?<br />A - Definitely Yes,<br /><br />Q - What to expect here?<br />A - Rides for both adults and kids. 4-D effect movies. Lots of places to click photographs. Super expensive food.<br /><br />Q - What are the Vegetarian Food options ?<br />A - Do not buy food from inside. They allow outside food so pack some burgers / snadwiches / anything you like from outside.<br /><br />Q - Do I need to cover all of it?<br />A - Yes, but only possible on weekdays or weekend with express pass.<br /><br />Q - What are its main attractions? <br />1) 4 roller costers mentioned earlier<br />2) Kids rides (dont remember names, just walk past by the 4 rides mention in #1 then they will appear)<br />3) Movie Show<br />4) Boat Ride (it was closed when I visited, but looked good)<br />5) There is a theatre sort of thing on left hand side right through the first passage after entrace.<br /><br />Q - Suggested Route to cover attractions mentioned above.<br />A - Just keep walking and watching there is just 1 route one can follow. <br /><br />Do not forget lockers are available for free for just 1 hour.

When you finally get your wristband you’re told that there are 4-5 rides that don’t even accept the pass and then there were 2 rides that were totally offline. <br /><br />To top things off about 20% of the park is shut for renovation. Obviously the ticket cost doesn’t reflect this. <br /><br />While the fast passes give you a shorter line, expect to queue for 45-60 minutes for the Battlestar Galactica rides otherwise it shows as 2 hours. <br /><br />Character meet and greets are advertised and timings are kept to relatively well but they’re all so devoid of any life. Everything feels so sterile. <br /><br />Food options are atrocious and RWS & Universal Studios should be ashamed of themselves. Half the restaurants are shut, those that are open are so full of people that you should expect to queue for 90 minutes just for fried chicken that you wouldn’t even touch after a night drinking in London because it is that inedible. <br /><br />We spent 40 minutes queueing for the cotton candy machine until the machine scammed the poor man in front of me and gave him a stick with nothing on it. There were no staff around to rectify the issue. <br /><br />The crowds are even worse.

In fact we had planned a trip with kids to Singapore specially for universal studios. <br />Big big disappointment for following reasons:<br />- Jurassic park rapids out of order<br />- waterworks out of order<br />- waiting time shown in queues absolutely incorrect<br />- express ticket unavailable & had to be booked 10 days in advance <br />- stood in queue for 1hr+ for “Revenge of the Mummy” which had waiting time of 30 minutes written & was told after 1hr that there is technical fault & they are not sure how much more time it would take. We had to come out using emergency gate and there was no staff to guide. Later after ride started, I requested if we can be given preference considering we had to come out after standing for more than 1hr but staff did not care<br />- some queuing areas not maintained well with water leakage etc<br />- big shortage of lockers & surprisingly free time for lockers much shorter than waiting time for rides so you end up paying 6-8 SGD for using locker for each","Family","0","","Written October 5, 2022","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

Was a saviour until we realised many rides werent  operating and some didnt accept the express pass. As youd expect at a theme park we paid astronomical coin for fairly average food. What we did find extremely bizarre was trying to find the place, we caught the cable car (rip off) to Sentosa but couldnt find a single signpost pointing us to Universal. We could kindve see the rides in the distance so just kept heading toward them, we ran into several other groups that were also lost.<br />Ive been to multiple Universals, Disneys, theme parks round the globe this one certainly doesnt stand out, but when you dont have much competition you dont have too.","","0","","Written October 4, 2022","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

Madagascar land being built so couldn't go there, Waterworld closed with nothing in its place, and the Jurassic Park water ride also closed.<br /><br />The park is also very small and we completed our first loop in 90 minutes.

The food is terrible, it’s totally inedible. It’s completely flavourless and everyone I spoke to in the restaurant said the same. <br /><br />Tours themselves were going ok until another very rude tour operator, not my own one, told me to go back to my group when I was standing with my group already (some girl in a clown makeup). Most of the staff were quite rude in general from the very beginning of the RIP Tour experience. They have hired some very young people to operate it and it shows. <br /><br />Also the booking system is misleading, it specifies the time you choose for the die-ning time but it’s actually the tour start time and you can’t enter before then. <br /><br />Just grab a normal ticket, none of the extras are worth it and the staff is terrible to work with.","Couples","0","","Written October 1, 2022","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

For the final day of our holiday, we decided to give it a go as we figured the kids would love it either way.<br />While it is certainly an expensive day, we are glad we bit the bullet. As stated on numerous reviews, there are a number of closed attractions and facilities however we still found a lot to see and do for our 3 and 6 year olds. It was a Sunday in the local school holidays so it was a busy day, but the waiting times were generally pretty good for rides. One in particular though could have been managed better - not filling each seat for the ride extended everybody's wait time considerably and it was no fun in the heat. <br />The Express Pass is definitely worth the extra coin if you intend on going on a few rides, as they saved a heap of time throughout the day.<br />Overall it was fun day and I would go back again.","","0","","Written September 18, 2022","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

For each main ride wait time is 1 hour. Huge queues as many rides are closed or malfunctioned (lucky we did not waste only in express pass). There were 3 of them transformer, Mummy and one SciFi roller coaster. Rest are small 2-3 rides. All other park areas are closed. <br /><br />We did wait for two rides transformer and one more but at almost time both malfunctioned and stopped. Total waste of 1 hour wait time each.<br /><br />Conclusion<br />- Overall, it was full of fun.<br />- Go there with open mind that park is not fully functional and you are OK to wait in queues. <br />- Kids will enjoy the smaller rides <br /><br />BTW, at the end they ask people to review them online and get one rubber fridge magnet.","","0","","Written August 28, 2022","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

Thought we would try to avoid the crowd. Nah we were wrong it was super busy. I was there 45 mins before it opened and already has over 300 people waiting in line. We had about 9 rides  for each of us . First ride took 90 mins. We were lucky 1.5 hrs before it closed. Many rides had no line up. We booked the ticket via one website when we buy 2 tickets at the time it 30% discount. So we ended up paid $50 SGD per ticket. Very cheap. I have seen lot of people bought Express passes.  Seemed work great. If you have a budget. Just  do it ! <br /> <br />Not many restaurants were open . You can bring food from outside. Maybe it will change in the future. They don’t check. I brought some snacks. Bring sunscreen and fan. Very very hot and humid.  Locker is free for the first 1.5 hrs. My daughters took advantage of it toward the end when there were no line up.

That too highly overpriced and arrogant treatment of guests. If you buy normal ticket expect to wait at least 2 hours for one ride. If you buy express then around 30-45 minutes. After you buy express there also comes a rude shock that quite a few rides don’t have express queue. <br />The park is really unorganized, small and filled with too many people. <br />Dubai parks and resorts are 10 times better with much better infrastructure. <br />This place in Singapore is really a bad let down. Do not go here unless you are really pressed to wall. Carry your own food. You will be much better off and at least avoid queues to pricey outlets. FYI - A pizza is priced at Singapore Dollars 40….!

First of all there are very few places to buy water, and the ones that are open had queues of 25 people with very slow service.  30 minute queue just to buy water for your kids.  Many outlets closed.<br /><br />The rides had horrendous queues.  First ride we went on said 20 minutes but the queue was 80 minutes.  The water ride said 60 minutes and forced everyone to buy a locker to keep your stuff dry but the wait was nearly two hours and we only got sprinkled so we didn't need the locker - just an aggressive money grab.  That was the theme throughout.<br /><br />With such long queues why doesn't the park open at 10am?  It opens at 12pm and winds down by 6pm so you really get to go on three rides maximum.  So many people I spoke to shared this frustration.<br /><br />Absolutely I would never recommend this place.

Die Themenwelten sind recht ausgewogen und die Fahrgeschäfte machen grundsätzlich Spaß.<br /><br />ABER:<br />* Die Fahrtzeit der Fahrgeschäfte ist äußerst kurz (teilweise gefühlt nicht einmal eine Minute), vor allem in Relation zur Wartezeit<br /><br />* Aufgrund der (optionalen) Express Tickets wird einem der Parkbesuch einfach nur vermiest und man ist hart an der Grenze, den Park erbost vorzeitig zu verlassen:<br />a) Der Park öffnet erst um 12 Uhr Mittags und schließt bereits um 7 Uhr Abends, man hat also bestenfalls 7 Stunden zur Verfügung, um sich alles anzuschauen und die Fahrgeschäfte zu nützen. Für $ 81 für Nichteinheimische ist das mMn sehr mager.<br /><br />b) Die Warteschlangen sind enorm (man steht teilweise mehr als 90 Minuten in der Warteschlange, und das an einem Mittwoch!) und das Erlebnis im Park wird durch die Vielzahl an verkauften Express Tickets noch zusätzlich arg getrübt: Während man ohne Express Ticket ewig in der Warteschlange steht, ziehen die mit einem Express Ticket Priviligierten ($ 91 Aufpreis für die Unlimited-Version und damit teurer als der eigentliche Eintritt, insgesamt dann $ 172 pro Erwachsenem!) an der Warteschlange in einer eigenen Spur an einem vorbei, während man selbst beim Warten versauert. Und als ob das nicht schon reichen würde, wird man ohne Express Ticket gleich doppelt benachteiligt, weil beim Einsteigen (wo sich beide Spuren wieder treffen) die Express Ticket-Inhaber nochmals bevorzugt behandelt werden und verhältnismäßig öfter einsteigen dürfen als ""Normalsterbliche"".<br />Leider werden anscheinend auch so dermaßen viele Express Tickets verkauft, dass man ohne ein Express Ticket einen Großteil des Tages in den diversen Warteschlangen verbringt, anstatt Spaß zu haben. Hier müsste dringend am Geschäftsmodell etwas geändert werden, so macht das Ganze definitiv keinen Spaß.<br /><br />Fazit: Aufgrund der Preisgestaltung und der Wartezeiten kann ich von einem Besuch nur dringend abraten!","","0","","Written August 7, 2022","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

This would be our third time going to universal studios in Singapore in 5 years and we had read some pretty poor reviews. Currently operating with reduced days, so we did have to plan which day we went and we chose a Thursday. Gates were open at 11:45, with some rides commencing their runs at 11:55.<br />We did not notice any difference in waiting times from when we visited pre-pandemic. Wait times for the Battlestar Galactica ride has always been around the 50 minute mark so don’t be discouraged when this has been  written in other reviews. It has also been at 90 minutes (this was a New Year’s Eve night), but on this visit there was only 50 minutes max. I was waiting with the youngest child while my eldest son went on the ride.<br /><br />The food court by the lost word / Jurassic park section is not open but there are plenty of food options - there is a pizza bar in the Sesame Street section, American Diner (Mel’s) off the Main Street, and in far far away some nachos, hot dogs and things.<br /><br />I’m not sure about the comments regarding no meet and greets, as we saw a number of these occurring. There were minions, Elmo and Oscar, Shrek and the Transformer character. These occurred throughout the day. Minions were every 2 hours. <br /><br />All rides were operating and there were no staggered times.<br />Water world show is not currently running.<br /><br />This was on par with our previous visits. <br /><br />Overall, a great day for our family which we thoroughly enjoyed.","Family","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/25/0b/4c/94/caption.jpg

Most rides were open when we visited. <br /><br />Locker area was crowded. Staff warned us that we will get wet at the water boat ride but they charged for the locker. Why spoil the whole experience for the guest when we have already paid for the admission tickets? <br /><br />Staff at most rides could be more polite, after all they are reflecting the Singaporean hospitality, which at times isn't great. <br /><br />Given that we are still in the pandemic, I would appreciate if staff enforce the mask wearing indoors rule and on the rides. Many pulled down their masks while queuing indoors or after the water boat has left the main station.<br /><br />We spent about 5 hours in the park and didn't buy any food.","","0","","Written July 31, 2022","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

Some rides were advertised as open 12-3pm only which caused rushes but they actually opened until 7pm so communication a big issue. Searches to take phones off people were random with some hiding them or simply by-passing searches - given that there were free lockers by the rides this was unnecessary. The lockers were free for a period but then a charge kicked in which was a nasty surprise after waiting 5x the indicated time!!!

When it comes to the express pass, what they don’t tell you in booking is they select certain rides you can’t use it on so you end up paying hundreds of dollars only to find you’ve wasted your money as express means slow or not allowed.  Such is my disgust with my visit I’m going to raise this with NBC Universal as I feel this park is seriously damaging their brand along with taking customers money and not providing any value for money.  And don’t get me started on the closed food outlets and the long queues on the ones that were open.  Someone seriously needs to take customer complaints seriously and not just continue to take money from customers in the full knowledge they’re not providing any value.

I can't believe they're charging what they are for the amount of rides and shows open/available. <br /><br />Additionally, this place isn't great for younger children (I had a 6 yr old with me), but rather for older kids and adults who like thrill rides. This, combined with all of the closures, there was barely anything age-appropriate for us to do. <br /><br />Treasure Hunter? CLOSED. Rock climbing wall? CLOSED. All those shows you read about online like Waterworld, Sesame Street, and Donkey LIVE? CLOSED. Magic Potion Ferris Wheel? CLOSED. Snack stands and key restaurants (Frairs, Lost World Food Court)? CLOSED. And that's just the stuff we targeted.  <br /><br />The Express Pass was useless and a waste --$100 down the drain. We used it on 2 rides! And for those 2 rides, it made no difference. In fact, the Sesame Street Spaghetti Chaser Express entrance put us in the same spot as everyone else, but made us walk even further to the queue (and due to some misrouting, actually led us out an exit). There was barely a line at the carousel. <br /><br />Effectively, the Universal Studios Singapore experience is about taking photos with characters (“meet and greets""), selling you retail stuff (plenty of shops open!), and keeping a few rollercoasters open to justify the admission price. Of course, they kept the rides open that sell you extra stuff --like the water ride where they can hard sell you a one-off locker rental ($10), a poncho ($5), and using a drying booth ($5). Or, the Transformers ride where they promo and sell you paid photo op with Optimus Prime. <br /><br />We left after a couple of hours of walking around.","","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/24/b4/4f/d6/paid-pictures-only.jpg

We didn’t pay for a fast pass but it appeared even those who did were waiting upwards of 30 mins for rides. <br /><br />Despite this, it is a fantastic day out with fun for all the family. The current Groovy Minions theme is cute and has various shows along the promenade where you can “meet the minions”. Great options for food and drink at fair prices. Plenty of souvenirs to buy and I thought they were a decent cost compared to theme parks in the UK. <br /><br />Well worth the trip over on the Sentosa Express and as the park is only open 12-7, plenty of time to explore the rest of the island before or after.","","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/24/8b/bd/c7/fountain-of-the-shrek.jpg

Then a lot of rides were shut at different times- some run from 12-3pm, others from 4-7pm so they only have half the rides open making the queues longer. A lot of food outlets were closed as well. The wait times were also very inaccurate- every ride we went on was at least 2-3 times as long as what was advertised. <br /><br />I was also pretty furious when after waiting for over 30 mins in a covid swamp of an underground queue (on a ride wait time of apparently 15 mins...), they then say over the loudspeaker that if you have any unsecured items (bags, hats, sunglasses) that you won't be permitted to ride! I had a hat on and was on my own so couldn't give it to anyone so had to leave the ride! Why didn't the guy at the entrance say something? <br /><br />Just a really disappointing (and expensive) day. Could be so much better if they opened it for full hours and had all the rides open.

The main dinosaur food court and restaurants were closed. Gotta queue for at least 20 minutes just for kiosk food.<br />- open just half a day 12-6pm.<br />- there were minimal, probably overstretched staff for each station.<br />- all shows were still closed, which they said it was due to social distancing but... it was more likely that they didn't have anymore entertainers.<br />- not necessary to get express passes, as there ain't many rides to use them on.<br />- pretty sad for the wheelchair-users, because 2 out of 4 wheelchair-friendly rides were closed. The promised-to-be-wheelchair-friendly Madagascar carousel ride turned out to be a false promise because the platform was too high for wheelchairs to get on... So only the 10-minute Shrek video was available, that's all.<br /><br />If you do plan to visit, just be prepared mentally that:<br />- you will pay the same pre-pandemic prices, for half the rides, time, maybe service.<br />- you may be surrounded by many hangry people. You might become one, too.<br />- if you are bringing someone on wheelchair, he/she will be paying the same price to play nothing, watch (almost) nothing, and have no respite from the torturous heat since there was almost ZERO air-conditioned places they could enter, except the crowded souvenir shops and the futuristic car museum at the far end of the park. Having a good attitude helps... but it might not ease your guilt-ridden heart.<br /><br />Plan wisely.<br />Have the right expectations.<br />Don't vent at the overstretched staff, who are already trying their best.","","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/24/1b/de/27/the-only-one-of-two-air.jpg","Written June 20, 2022","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

I used to own an annual pass to USS before covid. Comparisons:<br /><br />1. Tickets are now a swindle. Overpriced. Although they are opened at 12pm to 6pm, you barely get 30 mins to 1hr of fun (eliminating all the walking and LONG WAITING TIME you need to do inside). Psst: The waiting time on the average for EACH RIDE (1 RIDE ONLY PER PERSON) is about 45 mins to 240mins). For 30mins to 1hr, you need to pay almost a hundred bucks per ticket and usually you won't be going here if you are alone. So imagine you have to pay almost a hundred bucks x the number of people going... with the same duration of 30mins to 1hr... would you still go? Well, I had to cut down from a family trip to half a family going for the trip, mainly just me and the kids... From their ticket prices, you can already see that their business model now is mainly about money inflow.<br /><br />2. Although their memberships in the past were ridiculously expensive, I could still bring the family to USS during the holidays whenever I wish to. Now, they refused to renew any memberships and they stopped issuing memberships for obvious reasons. They can sell Day tickets at a swindle price and you won't get a second chance to visit this place without paying for another ridiculously overpriced ticket. Again, showing that their business model is leaning towards cash inflow into their cooperation.<br /><br />3. The rides were NOT MAINTAINED and there were parts of the rides that weren't working. I know where the errors are because I went there frequently before COVID and I went there again in June 2022. For example, the Madagascar Boat Ride, the beginning 3 stacked up crates were supposed to move slanted towards the visitors' boat, but instead, they stayed very still. Many of the lights were no longer functioning. The worst ride with most error was the Sesame Streets Space Ride where you sit in a ""spaceship"" and you enter ""space"". Not only were many lightings not lighted up, some of the animated characters did not even move. For example, the part where the Dustbin monster was supposed to pop out and back into the dustbin did not even pop out. The character that was stretched with hands and legs did not even move, etc.<br /><br />Again, unmaintained rides because the management decided to claw back as much cash inflow as possible to ""compensate"" their ""imaginary losses during the COVID"".<br /><br />Would you want to bring your beloved ones and family to a theme park with zero maintenance and charges you close to a hundred dollars for less than an hour's dangerous rides? You won't be able to predict when the malfunctions will get worse but you can almost be certain that a malfunction will surely occur soon. Because there is no maintenance.<br /><br />I don't understand why Tripadvisor is rating them as #1? Don't they know this is probably the last thing visitors will ever want to return to visit? What kind of theme park DOES NOT have an annual or seasonal pass and can still be rated as Rank #1 on Tripadvisor?<br /><br />Tripadvisor, you are discrediting yourself if USS continues to hold Rank #1. You are supporting a money-centered corporation instead of a visitor-centered corporation.","","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/23/e6/9e/3e/my-son-hated-universal.jpg","Written June 11, 2022","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

We did every single ride in just over 2 hours and then went back to ride again on a few that my daughter liked the most. I would not had bothered with the express passes if only I had known that there weren’t actually that many rides to go on as I’m sure we would had done everything in a day without paying the extra. There normal lines were up to 30 minutes and usually less for all the rides except the two big rollercoasters for which the express pass was actually useful.

Two adults. Cost per person €81. <br />The park isn’t opening until 12 which we couldn’t only figure must be staffing issues, later discussed with the customer service. <br />There are a significant number of shops, rides and restaurants closed in the park. Some say for maintenance, some just say closed. This is not advertised when you book your tickets at the front of the park and certainly not reflected in the price. The atmosphere in the park is empty, no characters, no parades happening. As a result of things being closed the queues are longer for the open rides. <br /><br />I genuinely couldn’t wait for my day out at universal and was so disappointed. <br /><br />We spoke with customer services who said they wouldn’t refund due to company terms and conditions, but would send us in with an express ticket to get on rides quicker.

I went there last year with my family :)<br />Read on to know this place better! <br /><br />However, it can get VERY crowded, so I recommend you to go on weekdays, if possible. When there, (if you are there on weekend) remember to go to the right hand corner to buy express tickets, or else you will need to wait for a very long time. We tried waiting for the  Transformers ride last time without express, and we waited for almost an hour! It will cost money, but I think it is worth it :)<br /><br />If you are bringing kids, I recommend you to make a stop at the first ride, and then move on to transformers. There is also a lot of thrilling and fun roller coasters. A memorable ride was the mummies, but there IS a height restriction. Many people will complain about the price of the food, but there is a pizza restaurant in Universal Studios which is absolutely delicious. However, if you don't want to pay the price, I suggest you buy the food from OUTSIDE the place as there are many appetising meals offered in the food court as well.<br /><br />The preferred time to play there is more than 3 hours, and it's best to play there for a whole day, or else you cannot really experience all the fun with the waiting.<br /><br />Some downsides, though. The castle, which I was looking forward too, is closed. I remember going to it last time, probably in 2019, and there was a movie inside, which was thrilling as well. The Water World is also closed, due to COVID-19, but if it does open again, the show is absolutely fantastic, and it was surreal. <br /><br />Overall, it was a nice experience, and there is a mini roller coaster for kids as well. Please remember to like my review!! :)<br /><br />Thanks for reading :) Hope you enjoy it there!","","0","","Written May 1, 2022","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

Honestly it was one of the worst experience I've ever had. For a family of 3, we paid SG$220 and it was not worth the price of admissions.  The first is, many of the shows were not available, like waterworld, the steven spielberg experience and others.  Secondly, there were many rides, especially for kids were not closed, and literally one fifth of the park, comprising the whole Madagascar area were closed off. But the worst part is that, the food and beverage services were incredibly AWFUL!!. Most of the restaurants and the beverage stalls are closed.  And when the stalls that are open are understaffed.  Just to get a bottle of water, people literally had to stand in a long queue, maybe as long as the ride itself.  With the day being really hot and the sun was shinning ever so brightly, people who are thirsty can be further dehydrated by being in line for 30 to 40 minutes for a bottle of water. And I guess Universal Studios fail and is too insensitive to realize that waiting too long when a person is dehydrated in a very hot day can cause so many negative health implications. Lastly the people who work there are so rude.  The way they respond towards my complaint or my inquiries was not within the standards of what a service oriented industry should be.  I didnt pay that much money to be treated like garbage.<br /><br />My message to the management of USS, if you guys are not prepared to take in visitors in a post pandemic new normal, then dont. And certainly, if you close off 15 to 20 percent of your park, dont expect people to pay that much. I honestly felt like USS ripped me off.","Family","0","","Written April 16, 2022","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

I've been to Universal a lot of times but this time it was just a little bit worse. The Madagascar area was renovating so I couldn't go there. I do recommend getting the Unlimited Express pass or the Express pass (For the express pass you have to purchase the amount of times you go on a ride altogether so I recommend getting the Unlimited Express pass )  so it was more easier to get on rides. The food was also good with some entertainment at times such as the Puss in boots performance/photo taking.  The gift shop things were a bit pricey as well as the food being a lot more dollars than it should be. I thought most of the rides were going to be closed so I had a lot more fun than I expected.","","0","","Written April 15, 2022","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

Some rides are closed altogether, but this doesn't stop the owners from charging full price. Overall, we had a very disappointing time as compared to our previous visits (4 over the past 3 years) we spent a lot more time standing in line and managed to only do a few rides. Shame they don't have the decency to cut the prices to reflect this, but rather fleece people full price for a substantially cut down offering. <br />Noticed that the template corporate-speak management reply to these comments here is the usual ""constantly reviewing to improve our products and services continuously to enhance the experience of our guests....truly appreciate the information provided....be assured I have shared your comments with our respective team and your constructive feedback will certainly be used for the continual improvement of our products and services"" - but that nothing is changing, which just proves the cynicism of this park management.<br />Bottom line - don't come here until covid restrictions end, and make sure all rides are on all day!","","0","","Written February 26, 2022","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

This just means you are operating at 200% capacity, with no enforcement of any safe distancing in the queues whatsoever.<br /><br />COVID-19 has been around for two years; it is not an acceptable excuse to shut down so much of the park and still charge the same amount.

In Short there a 7 Roller Coasters, 4 of these are ""high intensity"". Average wait time for most of the rides was about half and hour. We tried several times to go on the Jurassic park river rapid ride but wait time was almost 2 hours. At one stage all outdoor rides were shut down due to potential lightning which then pushed up wait times for anything inside. I would recommend paying the extra for express passes (unfortunately we didn't get these) during the day we saw people that paid for these basically jump the queue.<br />A few things to warned about... waiting in line there is no such thing as personal space!

We purchased tickets before leaving Australia as they were advertising 50% capacity with limited ticketing. $380 in pre-paid tickets. Arrived on our scheduled day early and the line to enter universal was over 90 minutes. It seemed all of Singapore was lined up and with absolutely no 1.5 meter gaps. Once we were in the rides were over 100 minutes wait with people up each others back sides lining up. Absolutely no social distancing being practiced. To avoid the queues, I went back to the store and purchased the express path which was another $300. When joining the Xpress lines people were right up each others back sides, again no social distancing and staff and park management couldn’t care less. When we got to the ride entrance it was clear the advertised “50% capacity” meant letting full capacity into the park, but closing every second seat or every second row depending on the ride therefore ‘limiting the rides’ to 50% capacity. Queues were upwards of 160 minutes on some rides because of “COVID POLICY”.  Yet, the “Carnies” operating the rides didn’t care that everyone in the line was up each others backside , but when it came to climbing in a ride, they made sure that each ride only had half the capacity of riders. Just dumb !! To top it off whilst in line for the first ride the heavens opened and the park closed all the rides for nearly 3 hours. No refunds, no save your ticket for another day, just  $680 down the drain. When several staff were approached as to when rides would reopen they just put their arms up in the air and pretended they didn’t understand English. It rained so much and for so long that there was no escaping it. All indoor areas were closed again because of this stupid Covid policy. Any chance of getting a meal meant you had to line up for over 150 m and it took me over 50 minutes lining up in the rain to get a hotdog for my kids whilst they were  standing under a tree getting drenched. The indoor food court undercover seating area in the Jurassic World section was closed  -  all they had to do was use their brains and apply some common sense as well as some respect for their patrons and open the doors. All the while I lined up for 50 minutes to order a couple of hotdogs only for it to take another 35 minutes for my number to be called. So after nearly 5 hours, we left and all we had to show for it was a saggy soggy cold meal, 3 kids soaked through in wet clothes, 2 rides, no entertainment and the privilege of paying $680 Singapore dollars for it. Park management and Singapore Tourism should hang their head in shame.

This results in visitors having to queue long long for the rides.

Nothing really suitable for young children and the weather was so hot. <br /><br />We spend 90% of the timing just queueing literally by 3plus we already don’t feel like staying there. <br /><br />The plus point to share is they started to change plastic mineral water to paper container type of mineral water, but there were no sign of recycle bin available around for us to throw. So what’s the point of changing to sustainable material but no option for people to recycle it ? <br /><br />Now they also reduce paper print and don’t give map anymore. Is a good move but when we try to download the USS app to check showtime / greet and meet. There were no reception at USS for long time. By the time I manage to download the app we already half way exhausted from queueing. There is definitely something wrong with the reception or network there. <br /><br />No sign of sanitization at any play area I guess they have no time no man power. Only one cleaner sanitize our dining table before we sit. <br /><br />Wish they could install more cooler fan around the area and provide more free sitting place. Even we buy drink or snack at the booth there are not many sitting places around we end up have to sit around the floor or staircase area to rest our tiring feet. Those outdoor area for restaurant are all left empty as the restaurant unable to cater more capacity but yet it remain cordoned up and public cannot use it like the past. Then they should rather don’t Corden the outdoor let it Be use by other public like the past or cordon half area for restaurant diner. Because there is no need to further check on vaccinated status since all have been check before enter. <br /><br />Hope to see some improvement.","Family","0","","Written December 16, 2021","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

It was not very crowded but there was still quite a wait for a number of rides. Was sad that Human Vs Cylon ride was under maintenance but all other rides were open. Due to SMM, ride capacity was reduced and as such, waiting time increased. Also, rides were operational at certain time slots so we had to run to certain rides so we could make it in time. Very sad that there were no shows or performances as these are my favourite part of USS. But oh well, understand that these are not possible cos of Covid. Still a good way to de-stress and enjoy the day with friends.

After the staff knew that she is able to transfer to wheelchair, she pushed out a wheelchair covered with black bag to let her sit and let us go through the express lane without having to queue for 40 min in the normal lane. We were amazed that all different rides has their own wheelchair covered with black bags n the staff applied the same standard service. They have made my mom's day accessible n enjoyable.

I absolutely love it! Albeit smaller than other USS parks around the world, it's still a slice of fantasy in a concrete jungle. <br /><br />Top tip: Reach early and head straight for the rides once they open, most people will be taking pictures at the entrance and hence, shorter queues.<br /><br />Food: <br />Pricey but tasty, even those sold at food carts. <br />I would recommend pizzas at Louis NY Pizza Parlour and Shrek waffles at Goldilocks.<br /><br />Rides:<br />A good variety from extreme (dueling rollercoasters) to kiddie friendly (Treasure Hunters). Wait times can be long, so I would recommend an express pass, especially if visiting during a peak period. <br /><br />Amenities:<br />Toilets are clean and well located, so u don't have to walk very far. Unfortunately the water coolers are all closed as it's the pandemic now. <br />Sufficient seats around the park.<br /><br />Staff:<br />I found them all to be very friendly and helpful, from those in retail, f&b and at the rides. <br /><br />Will definitely be back, at least once or twice a year 😁<br /><br />","Friends","0","","Written August 11, 2021","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

It was the June holidays and we thought we'd escape the crowd by going on Friday (USS was only open from Fri-Sun) however everyone thought the same so it was extremely crowded.<br />The average waiting time for a ride is about 80 mins. My niece wanted to go on the mummy ride and despite the sign saying it was an 80 min wait, we ended up waiting for 2.5-3hours. Turns out, the mummy ride only allowed 2 groups per ride = 4 people. So you imagine the wait. And because it took us so long to take the mummy ride, the lockers ended up charging us $4 because we exceeded the free 130 time limit. All the other rides were also packed or they stopped accepting people. I'd imagine that the rides were long wait due to safe distancing however some rides did not do such extreme safe distancing as per the mummy (4 people per ride).<br />The restaurants/food carts where we had food vouchers to spend were also packed as everyone was queueing at one or the other to use their vouchers. Not all restaurants and/or food carts were operating.<br />In the end, we only managed to ride about 3 rides after all the queueing and spent our vouchers in the late afternoon when everyone was queueing for rides.<br />I thought there was a capacity limit to entering USS however when we were scanning to enter, they didn't check against our date booking if we booked a slot. So am not sure if the limit was implemented.<br />I would love to go back again someday - but probably when there are no holidays or not on the weekends. Sadly, USS is only open towards the weekend.","","0","","Written July 5, 2021","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

Куча аттракционов, кафе, развлечений и прекрасный вид с острова на океан. Вот вам три причины сюда приехать: <br />1)  Множество разных развлечений, например,  аттракционов по мотивам Трансформеров. Вы садитесь в кресло, которые вращается во все стороны, и едете по рельсам. После этого вы начинаете вращаться во все стороны и погружаетесь в 5D атмосферу. Вокруг вас на экранах показывают действия из фильмов и вы как-будто являетесь соучастником событий.<br />2) Очень большое количество кафе на острове  на разный вкус и кошелёк: китайская кухня, тайская кухня, малайзийская кухня, европейская кухня. Всем советую посетить известную сеть почечных Dunkin donuts, где готовят очень вкусные пончики🍩. <br />3) Отели. На острове есть несколько отелей, которые славятся своей концепцией, а в некоторых есть сногшибательный вид на океан. Да, отели довольно дорогие, но несколько вариантов того стоят. Также, если вы поселитесь а одном из них, то у вас будет специальный абонемент, по которому вы сможете получить скидку на некоторые услуги.<br />    Также на острове имеется пляж, который находится в небольшой бухте с тёплой водой.<br />   Итог: посещение острова стоит своих денег, особенно если вы с детьми, потому что им тут точно будет очень интересно.

As a local, I've been to the park more than I can remember, including the 6 years of Horror Nights I have went, with season passes and frequent fear passes. It is safe to say I know the park at the back of my hands. <br />I love this place, simply because it is the only theme park in Singapore. I've been to USS for the second time since the pandemic started, once was in November 2020. Yes, coming on a public holiday, I expected crowds and the weather to be bad, totally understandable. Average waiting time for each ride around 5pm was 1-2 hours, okay sure, I can handle that, I've been in line for 3 hours for a haunted house before. I came with a group of friends that were new to theme parks and rides in general, so I really wanted to complete most of the major attractions with them.  What bugged me was how slack the social distancing was in some attractions. The Transformers and the Rapids ride had staff telling guests to remain in the boxes while queuing. While I was in the Mummy ride queuing, there was no social distancing enforced and everyone was just cramped together in the tight space. Not to mention, it was around 2pm and they had a technical fault, so we ended up getting on the ride only around 3.30pm, when asked the staff roughly how long it would take, they responded with a simple ""i don't know."" Me and my group were trying to remain in the boxes and maintain that distance with everyone else cramped in the indoor setting, but it was just impossible. Not to mention, as there was no staff there, many had their face masks down, which really bugged my group as we felt really exposed. <br />We were told the rides open at 2 and had early entry to the park. We went at around 12.30, searched for lunch and while eating, we saw that the rides have already operated at around 1.30pm, which caused abit of a rush and confusion for my group as we wanted to be first in line for BSG, but when we got there, it was already crowded. We went to Canopy flyer, which had a technical difficulty, we heard from some passing people that Transformers was down too, so if the rides had issues, shouldn't the park have made sure everything was good before opening the ride instead of rushing to open them? Just my 2 cents.The app for the wait times is a good idea but it doesn't update very frequently, so we have to run back and forth just to make sure that we have enough time to complete at least 3/4 of the rides. (Which we did, completed 10 thank goodness) But we did not stop to eat anything for the rest of the day till 9 pm to complete them. So for people coming on public holidays, please have a hearty meal before coming in as you might not have time to stop for food. We had corndog vouchers that came with the tickets, but the line for it was so long, probably about 50 over in the queue, so we gave it up. <br />We do understand crowds are something that cannot be controlled, plus even with the regulations, the limit for the park is still quite a lot. We just hope that more safe distancing can be enforced on such days as these are the days where more people will be exposed to the virus and people. When I came in November, almost every ride queue had someone to enforce the distancing. <br />I was quite disappointed yesterday, but I am still giving 5 stars because of my love for the park and the wonderful staff that still served with a smile on their face on a busy day. I will be back soon and hopefully, the social distancing system will be much more efficient and better.","","0","","Written February 13, 2021","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

We had a terrible experience on many levels. We are repeat annual pass holders. <br /><br />Let me start by saying we knew that there was a risk of crowds during the school holidays. Also, we know that we are in a unique situation with Covid and many businesses are struggling with the measures needed to keep safe. <br /><br />However, it seems USS are really putting guest experience low down on the list of priorities. Guest safety has to come of course but at what cost?<br /><br />The trouble for us started even before we got to in to the park. We arrived at 2pm and the entry queue was all the way passed Candylicious i.e. at least 500m away. I approached a USS staff at the queue and asked if there was still a priority line for annual pass holders. She told me ""no, please join the line."" So I had to walk all the way to the back of the line. After 1 minute of queuing another staff noticed our lanyards and said if we're annual pass holders then go to the front and use the priority queue.  <br /><br />Once in the park, the theme of queuing was everywhere. My 7 year old decided to queue for Enchanted Airways  so she went in alone and I was watching her from the front of the building. The queue moved and she went out of sight around the side of the building and I followed. I didn't notice at first but the queue went around the side of the building, down the back, and returned to the main entrance. What was appalling was that most of the queue was left exposed to the sun.<br /><br />This is unforgiveable. It showed me right there that USS are more concerned about $$$ than people. <br /><br />I pulled my daughter out of the queue as she said ""Daddy, this is too much"". <br /><br />Every single other ride we stopped at (including the Madagascar merry go round) looked like the wait was at least 45 - 60 mins. The more popular rides I would say you'd need to queue for at least 90 mins - 2 hours. This is just nuts. <br /><br />We spent the rest of the afternoon just going around the shops and people watching. One thing that USS did do well was putting on more frequent character shows which was enjoyable. <br /><br />Then we tried to get into Mel's Drive In for dinner. Guess what, we had to queue to get in, had to queue to order and then wait for the food prep. <br /><br />All in all this was a terrible experience for us. Again I want to say that this is no fault of the staff in the park. This issue is firmly with senior management and their interpretation of what is acceptable sacrifice under the current management measures. It looks like they've decided that guest experience is the first to go. <br /><br />I am a senior operations leader in the real estate industry so I know full well how hard it is to get a balance at the moment. But for USS, the numbers in the park simply need to be controlled better. They've got the balance wrong right now and guests are suffering. <br /><br />We will not be renewing our annual passes again.","","0","","Written December 30, 2020","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

Ive never seen a double booking system because of covid and other attractions like WWW are able to manage crowd amazingly please improve on this and don't just think of the money and end up overbooking yourselves.","","0","","Written December 27, 2020","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

In the afternoon 2-3-4 quite a lot of ppl but def worth it there's social distancing crew and make sure every body is in place they are extremely friendly and kind aswell. 1 ride prob needs 30-60mins in the afternoon. (depends on what ride u are going for). If u are wondering if the rides are open during rain? For my experience when I was queuing for the battlestar galactica it started to rain and they didn't close at all. They will only close when there thunderstorms/lightning or very bad heavy rain. But yea they still open it when it's drizzling and raining:) When at night around 7-8 most rides queue are rlly short. For my experience I rided the human and cylon at around 8-9 and there was honestly no queue only for the cylon only a few people in front but at night the view are spectacular! I recommend booking first before coming. Cause going inside without booking queue could be quite LONG. And I mean it. Most food restaurants are close but the ones open queue are long aswell and expensive but the food is very delicious! Don't bring too much stuff or big bags into uss as when yr riding the attractions u HAVE to put yr belongings in the locker and the lockers are quite tiny. The lockers is free for the first 45 mins so when yr going to change your attractions rides u should change to another locker that is close to the ride if you want free lockers. <br />Rides I recommend for teens or adults that's above 125 in height: revenge of the mummy,cylon,human<br />For kids:Puss in boots and other kiddi rides:)<br />Personal for me the cylon and human (Battlestar Galactica) is the BEST! I def recommend you coming here!! It's a good tourism attractions 👍","Family","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/1c/76/4f/eb/universal-studios-singapore.jpg

Because I was busy, I could not book my time slot beforehand. I also did not receive the confirmation email with my son's ticket confirmation number until 2.42am on the morning of 21 December. I need that confirmation number to book the time slot. This is my second time booking the ticket online; the first time, all went smoothly. This time, I had to deal with a dismissive staff member, Nur Amirah Huda, who told me that the confirmation email had been successfully sent to me. What use is it if it's sent to me only on the morning of my booking? All the time slots have been taken up! Nur Amirah also told me to check my junk email often, as if I don't do that. So dismissive. I'm now left to deal with it myself. I probably have to forsake the ticket. School is reopening, and I won't have time to go.

After lunch , we decided to visit the ride called “Puss in Boots Adventure”<br /><br />Our daughter checked the description from the YouTube video and it stated that it is a gentle ride. We queued up and was informed by the duty personnel that there was a slight delay in starting the ride as they needed to “TEST” the ride.<br /><br />After a half hour wait , about 2 pm we boarded the capsule ( four of us in one capsule ) ‘<br /><br />The capsule glided upwards slowly. Then the ride downwards began to gain speed  after we reached the Higher levels and  very soon it suddenly jammed to a stop  abruptly ( similar to someone braking very hard as the car was travelling at speed 40 KM/hr.)<br /><br />The abrupt and sudden stop caused our body to hit very hard against the safety bar in front of us. (Forward momentum and sudden stop )<br /><br />Before we could recover , the capsule moved forward again at fast speed for 30 seconds before coming to another abrupt and sudden stop . This again caused our body to lunge forward and hit against the safety bar / restraint. Then it moved forward at a fast speed again<br /><br />After a couple more of such unpleasant and abrupt stops , we reached the end of the ride.<br /><br />Our complaint is that<br /><br />1.Such abrupt “stop and start” are intentional and caused by the technician's programme.<br />2.it was unexpected that this ride would be so violent , jerky and unsafe. We spoke with the staff at the gate when we queued up and she said it is  a slow gentle ride downwards.<br />3.It caused great discomfort to us and others during and after the ride.<br />Please investigate and give us a reply  soonest.","","0","","Written December 14, 2020","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

Truly regret booking the tickets as I find that USS is just profiteering from people who use their SingapoRediscovers vouchers. <br /><br />Given the fact that the park now operates within limited hours - 2 pm to 9 pm only, effort should have been made to control the number of people who are able to book and enter the park on any given day, to provide a conducive environment for all. However, this was not the case and for some rides, the waiting time was 2 hours, after which all other visitors were turned away as the queue was temporarily closed. Most other rides had a waiting time of between 1 hour and 1.5 hours. <br /><br />I hope that the USS management will look into this matter and strive to be more sincere in their offerings to the public. Although most people would be using the SingapoRediscovers vouchers, at the end of the day, it is still money and it could have been better spent elsewhere.","Family","0","","Written December 12, 2020","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

I have visit USS many times and this is the only one time that we couldn't wait to leave the place.  Firstly, although early entry is at 12 noon, rides only start at 2 p.m. Some were opened a bit earlier.  During normal time, the 2 hours could be just nice for us to grab a bite, do some shopping or walk around to catch some meet and greet.  But unfortunately, there was very limited food outlets opened, so each food outlet has long queues.  And the meet and greet sessions were few and far in between.  So it was a really boring 2 hours.  <br /><br />Once the rides started at 2p.m., the queues are super long.  This is due to some shows and rides are not opened plus the fact that most restaurants and food outlets were closed, yet there is a good crowd.  Hence the visitors would have nothing to do but to take the rides.  Each ride queue is really 1 hour or more.  So be prepared to maybe have maximum 5 rides during your visit.  Worst still is when it rains, as the restaurants were closed, there is little place for shelter. <br /><br />The place also looks very much in need of a good uplift, paint work is getting faded and dated and looks unattractive.  Also please do thorough checks for technical glitches before the rides open and not during ""showtime"".  Imagine queueing for more than half hour and then hearing announcement that there are technical glitches and the time for rectification is indeterminate.  Very disappointing.","","0","","Written December 12, 2020","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

How are people suppose to enjoy the trip to USS with almost 40% of the rides closed. People spent so much money just to visit. Other than that, what's the point of having time slots when there are still so many people in the park. It is honestly more than the amount of people I went when there was no pandemic. The workers did not even bother to check the time slots whether it's 2pm or the other time slot. There was crowds everywhere, crowding in areas, so many restrictions were broken. I only manage to ride 1 ride after 3 hours, two of the rides I've been to closed down mid way, the rest were fully crowded with people as the main attractions were close. It was definitely a disappointing experience for me and it was saddening. hopefully you guys can do something about it.","","0","","Written December 11, 2020","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

The rides are very wimpy by world standards and even the two main roller coasters are far below modern standards. The Transformers and Mummy rides are probably two of the best attractions. The Jurassic Park water ride is fun but quite lame in its intensity: it's almost like they went out of their way to avoid you getting wet with things squirting OVER YOU rather than onto you. Some of the ride elements on Jurassic Park also needed obvious upkept. The rest of the rides are mostly for children and low thrill adults. The Canopy ride is super short (like 30 seconds) and offers only small children a thrill. There's another small coaster by the castle (forget its name) that looks like it's for children but is actually kind of cool for its size. Elmo's Spaghetti Ride is one of the parks nicest imaginative surprises and is easy to overlook: a must for children of all ages.<br /><br />Universal Studios Singapore may be one of the best things to do in Singapore but as for theme parks, it's on the lower end by world standards.","","0","","Written November 22, 2020","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

The food is just horrid and extremely overpriced, so make sure to leave the park to eat food. <br />In general, this park is far more suitable for children. When it comes to teens/adults, there aren't many rides that give you adrenaline except Cyclon and Human. The park is not very refurbished, and the architecture isn't as beautiful as other Universal Studios/ theme parks in general. <br />Theme parks are supposed to have themes, obviously, and the Singapore Universal studios has really tacky themes that are basiscally just paint. <br /><br />The only attraction I would reccomend is the Water works performance, as it is quite entertaining.

Playing pretend to be tourist in own country on a weekday has its perks as crowd is much thinner, mostly due to COVID-19. Interestingly, where we didnt see a lot of people, the rides are chock full of them as the waiting time stretches up to 1.5 hrs to 2 hrs, notably due to social distancing and limited number of people can get on the rides due to enforcement of distancing. It is a good thing actually. Kudos to the staff for diligently wiping down every seat and cabin whenever each ride is completed. Timed tickets have to be issued for certain rides as they are overwhelmingly popular. Good idea though as it spaced out the crowd but at the same time created additional long queues to get the tickets.","Couples","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/1b/c4/15/d1/20200730-155811-largejpg.jpg

Be prepared as there is a lot of walking involved and worst of all is that you WILL end up standing in the lines for a long long time.  Depending on when you go, you may only have a chance to go on the rides only once.  The worst part is waiting in the lines for the rides however, if you have a fast track pass then you will possibly end up spending less time in the lines but you will no less need to wait as there are a number of people who purchase the express passes.  <br /><br />Other than this, the rides are enjoyable and fun.  From the Transformers ride to the Mummy's revenge and Jurassic Park (you will get wet in this ride), these are fun filled and exciting.  The Cyclone rollercoaster is a very fast fun filled adrenalin rushed ride and totally worth it (if you are not afraid of being twisted and spun upside down).  <br /><br />Food is overpriced as expected and sadly the pizza were not up to standard and £ ended up wasting over $30.00 there.

Which was not advised in advance.<br /><br />Entry to park was relatively easy, however, overall experience was very much reduced by the very RUDE, AGGRESSIVE, AND DISRESPECTFUL 'so called' SAFE DISTANCING AMBASSADORS deployed throughout the park, in numbers it seemed more than the park employers. These folks truly made the experience truly forgettable...<br />-yelling at families walking too closely together<br />-harassing families of 3 and 4 lining up for rides, informing them that even families of 3 and 4 cannot line up together for rides due to alledged government regulations (which is incorrect as the government rule is now groups of 5).<br />-just generally being RUDE and lacking any customer service training: for example ""Sir, please stand being the line... SIR, YOU ARE STANDING ON THE LINE""<br /><br />Generally regular employees were pleasant, however, reduced capacity on rides made posted waiting times to be very inaccurate.<br /><br />Rides were operating at slower than normal intervals, which, along with reduced capacity on each ride led to very long waiting times given park admission was supposed to be limited to 25%.<br /><br />A number of attractions were closed.<br /><br />Overall disappointing experience given there was no discount on ticketing.<br /><br />Recommendation: AVOID UNTIL PARK HAS PROPERLY REOPENED and SOCIAL DISTANCING AMBASSADORS RECEIVE PROPER  CUSTOMER SERVICE TRAINING.","Family","0","","Written July 27, 2020","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

And hold on, the attractions were:<br />- 2 times Transformers,<br />- 1 time one of the Galactica (for which we waited 1h30 in the queue)<br />- 1 time a very lame attraction next to the Galactica, because there was no-one queuing. <br /><br />At some point, we had some hope to go in the Mummy because we were given a pass for a later timing, but once there on the expected time, the announced queue was more than 1 hour. WTF!<br /><br />Please review your number of admissions in the park, or try to be more efficient on the cleaning, and do not allow the unlimited fast pass.

You're getting a park with a few great rides but it is only a small place so for any age group there's likely to be less than 5 attractions that really hit a sweet spot.  Its a theme park and it's in Singapore so of course it's not cheap and I'd say it's generally worth the express pass if you don't want to devote a full day and 40+ mins queueing per ride.  Human, Cylon, Mummy and Transformers are the proper thrill rides and all good fun.  <br />The F&B options are terrible and USS should be ashamed that they don't offer any healthier choices than highly processed food and drinks packed with additives, sugar and salt.   It's 2020 and I think they are misreading their customers... I think a lot of people now want healthier, lighter options.  Get a Salad Stop franchise in there, an Acai Affair and a Sushi Tei, to provide a bit more variety.  <br />The worst thing about the park is the pipes music which is inescapable everywhere and seems to be the same 10 song playlist blasting out.

Obviously the park issues tickets only 25% of usual capacity due to Covid-19, though the park was busy as always and with safety measure in place and lot's of cleaning in-between the rides, the waiting time was outrages. My kids arrived at 2pm and left at 7pm highly disappointed. We had to pay full price (85 SGD) and my complaint to the management wasn't heard off. I strongly recommend to avoid the park - at least during Covid-19 restrictions on the rides (not on the people as they have to make to money and allow full crowed to come in).","","0","","Written July 14, 2020","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

One of the best show is the fireworks show. There are two kinds of fireworks show, one is in Jurassic park and the other one is a normal fireworks show in midnight. Many tourists love to come to this place, without visiting this attraction they haven't completely or half visited Singapore.  There are many easy and comfortable ways to reach this attraction. There are also many shops in here. They are always at the end of the rides. You can even see your photos in some of the rides. I recommend every traveler to visit this place. There are also amazing and yummy food restaurants. There are also Hollywood movies available to see. You can also take an annual or seasonal pass! You can even go to the Adventure Water Park through there. I love this place so I visit it many times.

Amid the Covid-19 outbreak, the staff was maintaining absolute cleanliness and every ride was being sanitized persistently. Even the washrooms were cleaned frequently. <br />The rides were so good! For the first timers: You should start your journey from Madagascar zone and end your day with New York zone as the intensity of rides this way, goes on from Level 1-10. If you want to start with the most thrilling rides, then do just the opposite of the previously said option.<br />The park also consists of various vendors selling ice-cream, soda, Coke, and other refreshments in every zone. Also, each zone includes restaurants. I ate at Oasis Spice Café located in Ancient Egypt zone. It has a wide range of vegetarian and non-vegetarian food items. You can always share and eat if you are in a group. <br />Also, almost every ride has sinks inside to fill your empty water bottles, which is really helpful during sunny days.

When we first arrived the park was extremely busy, and then we saw it very quiet when the coronavirus cleared Singapore of most visitors.<br />Although the park is small, it never feels crowded.  But at first we did find queue times excessive, worse than on previous visits to Singapore.<br />Rides are well maintained and compared to the UK breakdowns are infrequent.  There is a good choice of rides, from exciting roller coasters to gentle well themed rides.<br />In addition the park is well themed, so do spend some time just enjoying this; don’t miss the walkway around the lake, you get some great views from there.<br />Food in the park is good, but expensive.  However do think how much you’ve paid to be in the park, I feel it’s better to accept the higher prices and enjoy the experience in the well themed restaurants, rather than save money by leaving the park.<br />There’s an app which is a fairly easy way to get park opening hours but watch out, it doesn’t open to the day of your visit, it always opens to the first of the month, sometimes the previous month.  Queue times are erratic, and often incorrect, but it gives you some idea of how busy the park is.<br />Even when the park was busy, there was quite a gap between shows at Shrek and Lights Camera Action.  They won’t give a countdown timer for the next show, nor tell you when the show starts, so assume you’ll have to wait for the full waiting time displayed at the show entrance.  Only Waterworld has shows at set times which is clearly displayed.<br />There’s a fountain area near the food court in Jurassic Park, it’s been broken for over a year.<br />I’m disabled and I find the staff gave us an exceptional amount of help.  Because we spent quite a few days in the park we were recognised and warmly welcomed when we arrived, and staff made sure we had an easy entrance to the park.  They also ensured we had a really good time going on the rides.<br />By contrast, the design of the park is poor for the disabled.  Full marks to Enchanted Airways for providing a special staircase for the disable, nice wide gentle steps, and even a stairlift.  But why oh why didn’t they give the staircase a handrail?<br />The disabled could enjoy all the shows, but the design really spoils the shows for the disabled.<br />Shrek 4D, we had to enter the theatre early, and missed part of the pre-show.  That was our only complaint, although we always have to sit rather to one side.<br />Waterworld, the disabled sit at the very back.  In addition I couldn’t see the most spectacular stunt, because a block of speakers blocked my view.  I used to really enjoy the show when I could sit near the front, I won’t bother to watch it again, I was so far from the action.<br />Lights Camera Action, after baking in the queue area I was required to stay at the very end of the row, and couldn’t see most of the show.  Really disappointing, I won’t be going again.<br />If you live in Singapore, I’m sure you’ll have a great time there while visitor numbers are low.  Let’s hope tourism starts again, I’m looking forward to enjoying the rides, great shame about the shows.","","0","","Written April 23, 2020","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

The park is divided into different sections according to the movies and each section has some amazing rides. Since we had quite a lot of time, we did most of the rides if not all. We went at around 1pm in the evening and stayed till 10:30 when it closes and honestly you can do more rides in the last 2-3 hours than in the whole day as the rides have very long queues during the day. There are rides for all ages. There are multiple shows which take place in a day. Since we went around Christmas time, we  got to  see the Christmas Spectacular Fireworks  which were also good.","","0","","Written April 12, 2020","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

I was accompanied by my wife 2 years daughter and my senior citizens mother father .<br />The main attractions are both the roller coasters and the dark room roller coaster means 3 rides and the transformer ride , if you do these 4 rides your ticket value you have used it as these 4 rides are very new and uncommon in other parks anywhere else . <br />For the food veg options are very less , you can take your own in bags , rest options are also very expensive . <br />Some pics I have attached for the reference but if you have gone in a peak season the ques are huge so be at time at 9 am sharp When gates are open, as sharp 5 PM they close all rides and no entry is allowed . <br />Take care love you readers and be safe at home. <br /><br />Mohit jain<br />Mumbai , India","Family","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/1b/40/6c/34/universal-studios-singapore.jpg

В связи с угрозой короновируса народу мало и аттракционы работают до 5 вечера. Очереди отсутствуют, поэтому катались на чем хотели и сколько хотели.  Дочка теперь уверена, что Шрек, жители мультика «Мадагаскар», Кот в сапогах, трансформеры и другие живут в Сингапуре. Ведь именно там им построили такие великолепные домики –замки!!

This included painstakingly marking out the queueing areas with boxes to ensure social distancing and wiping down the rides with sanitizer after every round of rides. Do visit the park when it opens at 10am as queues are shortest at that time. Also download the Universal Studios Singapore app as it will help indicate the updated waiting times so that you can maximise your time in the park instead of waiting unnecessarily. Battlestar Galactica and Canopy Flyer always seem to have long waiting times so you should try to target those first.

Haha!) The experience is totally different from my previous trips to this amusement park because there are no queue at all. The thrill rides are awesome as always. The Mummy is still my favorite, followed by the Transformers and then The Jurassic Park Rapids. The staff are friendly and helpful especially when someone is having trouble with the lockers. Local food is better outside though. But all in all, a day in USS is still a fun (and tiring) day. Be sure to wear comfy shoes. :)","","0","","Written March 12, 2020","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

Very clean throughout with friendly staff. Because of the corona virus scare the park was very empty with only about a five minute wait for any ride which was perfect as we had three young children with us!  Easily walkable for any age. My family had annual passes and it was $38 for my day pass. If you go with someone who has a pass you get a reduction from regular fare.  Prices for food and gifts in the various places were what you would expect in a theme park.  The Mummy ride had technical issues while we were on it meaning we had to get off it!  My seven year old granddaughter was being brave and trying it for the first time with her Mom and I and was freaking out a bit at the mummy room when it stopped!  Now her Mom and I were temporarily freaking out a bit lol.  Since they needed to turn on the lights to get us off the ride she saw the special effects which made it possible to get her back on it when it was fixed. She absolutely loved the ride and can’t wait to go back again!   It’s a great ride!  All the rides were fun and we had a great time there. It’s a fair bit out of the city and it seems the best way to get there is a grab or a taxi.","Family","0","","Written March 10, 2020","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

The highlight was the transformers ride, which we did several times, a ""rollercoaster"" without moving, all done via video - excellent for those of us with bad backs and necks. The Shred 4D was great fun, most of the other rides were ok, but if we had had to have queued for 30m+ for each, we would have been very disappointed. At c$80pp we managed to get our value, particularly from transformer ride. We saw an excellent dance crew in the Hollywood zone. We didn't try the main rollercoasters (not physically up to it).<br /><br />Overall, it's very compact and probably not enough rides to justify the price at very busy times, but having virtually the entire park to ourselves was quite fun.","Couples","0","","Written February 22, 2020","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

It's well worth it since even for the mediocre rides there can be long waits. <br />2) get there early - it gets very hot in mid day so get there as early as it opens so you can do 1 or 2 rides before lunch time.<br />3) if you want the big rides, go there 1st. Dont waste time seeing everything along the way. The park is small, so you will get a chance to see. The big rides get very busy, so go there quickly!

Since the Corona virus panic there is very few people and no ques so we were able to go to all attractions with basically no waiting time. The kids loved every one of the rides and they have different rides for every age. Only one ride (the red rollercoster) was closed due to maintenance work but as it was announced to us in the ticket counter we had no problem with that. We loved that many of the attractions were suitable for our 4-years old he is fearless but if your child is more shy you should consider going few years later. The staff is really friendly and there is pleanty of restrooms and places to buy water etc. Despite some negative comments in internet saying it is dated etc I still would recommend it if you have not been to places like this. Full day of fun for kids and it was such a joy to see them so happy!","","0","","Written February 17, 2020","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

Sadly they had curtailed the timings from 10:00 am to 5:00 pm so we missed out on a few rides. To ensure the best please check the timings before you go to universal. Weekends the park is open for a longer periods. The parade is another added attraction which takes place occasionally and I believe is mentioned on their site. We went their when the corona virus scare  had created a lot of panic so we did not have to wait at all for the rides. The transformers, mummy returns and the roller coaster rides are simply amazing and shouldn’t be missed. There are various shows happening on the premises and the timings are mentioned on pamphlets kept at the entrance. The show for kids that we managed to see were the seasame street show and donkey show which was laughable and for all ages. There are lots of resturants,snacks counter, toilets and water filling stations spread over the premises. It is generally hot round the year so keep yourself well hydrated at all times. Download their free app to make your visit better.

I was concerned before arriving that we will waste the day if we didn’t have a fast pass (based on previous experience) but as it was a quite season with no school holidays I am glad we saved the money. My friends and I were able to go on all the rides we wanted, multiple times and meet the different characters. The longest we waited all day was 30 minutes, the shortest was about 5 minutes.

The ride broke down halfway through my queue. In the end, the waiting time which was supposed to be 45 mins came up to be nearly 2 hours as they keep letting express pass holders through instead of clearing those who were stuck during the breakdown. Upon returning to the locker<br />immediately after the ride, it was locked up due to expiry of time limit and I was forced to pay a fine to retrieve my belongings despite trying to explain the situation to the locker crew. There weren't any staff that could redress such issues at the BSG. There weren't any staff available along the way as well and I have to make my way all the way back to the ticket entrance customer service. And there was such a long queue that the usher outside the office advised me to come back later. <br /><br />Basically, it is compulsory to place all your belongings in lockers located near the entrance of thrilling rides. I have seen more than a few riders being sent off because they have stuff inside their pockets just before their turn for the ride. You will definitely be bored to death while queuing more than 60 minutes without your mobile phone and stuff, especially if you are a single rider. So be mentally prepared.","","0","","Written February 5, 2020","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

The main problem with sentosa island including universal studio at Singapore is that there is no public relations booth and the visitors are left in the dark with no one to give/ inform directions. With this type of infrastructure and with so much money flowing the management should have couple of public relations booth at all places to guide visitors which today's date  is completely lacking. Please do not go on Friday to Sunday as for each ride the waiting period would be more than two hrs which is quite  irritating.  If a visitor is buying tickets it is better to pay more and get express tickets, as the express tickets  entitles a person a priority of entering a ride compared to regular ticket and in the process a person can do all rides . In a  regular ticket a person can never complete all the rides due to the enormous queue.

The day started in a very crowded and chaotic 'VIP lounge' so busy there wasn't a place to sit and I stood filling out the paperwork being jostled by people. The two of us were paired with a family of three, who were very nice, but were interested in different things to us (we wanted to do all the thrillseeker rides and not interested in shopping, photo ops or kid stuff).<br /><br />Our guide Man Xuan was excellent. Not only did she arrange our day based on what we wanted to do, she held our bags while we went on rides, made sure we got the best seats, and made suggestions for things to do, where to eat and where to sit at the activities based on our preferences. The longest we waited for a ride was for the previous one to end and this is why the VIP price was completely worth it. <br /><br />We were at the park for 6 hours (10-4) and the guide was with us for the entire time, except for a lunch break. In that time we went on every ride we wanted, Transformers and the roller coasters were excellent and we loved the hilariously enjoyable Shrek 4D show. It's a small park but we couldn't have done everything we wanted without the 'skip all the queues' VIP pass. The other family left the tour for a couple of hours to go and do things they wanted to do, which is probably not ideal when you have paid for VIP. <br /><br />I'd never been to a theme park before and wasn't sure I'd like it but absolutely loved it! We had a fantastic day and highly recommend the VIP to really get the most of the park, but yeah, be aware you might be paired up with others with different ideas about what a great day at the park looks like.","","0","","Written January 25, 2020","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

We got there at 9.40am and gates were open and so got on to a few rides with no queing. But then the ques became quite long and there was no staff to manage the line or direct people as there was confusion about what was express line and regular line  (E.g. sesame street). Also staff were letting just 2 people onto 4 seater carriage and so some rides were not being used to full capacity despite 1 hour wait. I think some revision of how ques are managed is required as no one really wants to wait an hour for a ride that lasts less than 5 mins.<br /><br />Our 7 yo is not into roller coasters or high rides so after about 3 hours we were done and I left feeling underwhelmed.<br /><br />As a family experience it was fun, however I think it is expensive and to pay a substantial amount extra for express tickets is not fair when base ticket price is already $80. With better management of the park I think some of the inefficiencies could be avoided and the park experience improved.","Family","0","","Written January 25, 2020","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

Ich denke pauschale Be-/Abwertungen wegen Warteschlangen sind immer ""problematisch"" weil das extrem von Saison, Jahres- und Uhrzeit abhängt - von daher will ich mich auf den Park an sich und das Preis-Leistungsverhältnis beschränken. (Ungeachtet der Tatsache dass der Park bei uns relativ leer war - und ungeachtet dass es Nachmittag geschüttet hat wie aus Eimern und einige Attraktionen daraufhin aus Sicherheitsgründen geschlossen wurden - dafür kann ja der Park nichts!)<br /><br />Also das gesagt nun folgendes: Die Studios sind eine kleine Kopie des Originals aus Hollywood, vieles sieht gleich aus, einige Bahnen und Attraktionen sind 1:1 Kopien. Der Park ist insgesamt ca halb so groß würde ich schätzen, aber für Familien perfekt um das ohne Hektik an einem gemütlichen Tag zu erledigen. Das Preis-Leistungs-Verhältnis ist absolut ok.  Zum Thema ""Abzocke"" was hier einige bemängeln ein paar kleine Hinweise (Freizeitparks sind immer etwas teurer, ABER): Wir hatten ein paar Sandwiches und Getränke mitgenommen und direkt in der Mall (wo die Monorail abfährt) an einem der zahlreichen ""Fressbuden"" ausgiebig gegessen....das hat alles für den ganzen Tag gereicht, wir haben keinen einzigen $ im Park ausgegeben - außer eben dem Eintritt. Und selbst den haben wir im oberen Stockwerk der Mall wo die Monorail abfährt gekauft mit Rabatt. In der Summe hatten wir einen absolut tollen Tag mit vielen Fahrten und sehr viel Spaß rotz Regens. Zu empfehlen, daß die Kinder mindestens so um die 1,20m groß sein sollten....da können sie wirklich die meisten Bahnen (manche in Begleitung) fahren.<br />Ich würde auf keinen fall diesen Fast-pass kaufen, wenn man mal anstehen muß, dann gehört das denke ich dazu. Wer in so einen Freizeitpark geht, sich dann ärgert dass das essen da drin teurer ist als bei McDonald und er sogar anstehen mußte, hat in meinen Augen sich nicht vorher überlegt was er da tut. Wer das akzeptiert wird hier einen ganz tollen spaßigen Tag erleben!","","0","","Written January 25, 2020","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

Everything was as expected: long queues in hot weather. 7 hours on our feet. Only did about 7 rides. At the end of the day we chose to go as single riders because you can jump the queue. The only thing is that you won’t be able to ride together but it’s worth it to beat the queues. They need to provide more drinking fountains and water sprays. The donkey live show was disappointing. Just a cartoon caricature. The 4D shrek show was very entertaining. My girls were disappointed that there was no Harry Potter World. The food was very limited. If you’re a health fanatic there’s nothing for you except water. All fried fast food. We were so happy to eat a salad once we got out of there. All in all, it is a must do for your kids, but only once.

It was very busy! We had to wait for over an hour for most of the rides! We didn’t do all the rides due to waiting for so long. Advised to buy express pass if you can afford it! Buy it few days in advance  as the price seems double if you buy it at the entrance. Customer service needs improving. If you decide to leave the Universal studio please bring the ticket even though you get stamp it doesn’t count. They staff initially refuse to let me in as I didn’t have my ticket. My partner has the ticket on his phone. The staff wanted my partner to bring the ticket who happens to be  lining up for the rides over an hour with my two children, which I had to explain to her and pretty much begged to let me in. I was not happy person. The staff eventually let me in when she requested evidence of the photo on my phone that I been inside.  Another complaint is my partner wanted to sit down on the bench who has swollen feet but was told to move as he will be in the way because photo getting taken, even though there was big wheelchair next to the bench. It was hard waiting for long period just to go the rides with two little children who is getting grumpier due to waiting for long periods  just to go to the rides. The weather didn’t help it was hot and humid. There is no chair to sit down while your waiting for over an hour. If you can afford it buy express pass. What makes it worse there was a young boy who had express pass went on the same ride 8 times while there is lots of people who has been waiting for over an hour. Maybe have a time frame when that person can come back or limit entrance to 2-3 times just to make it fair for everyone who has been waiting for so long.

I certainly recommend anyone visiting the park during peak seasons to book the express pass as normal queues tend to be longer with waiting time of more than 1hr. The express pass queue is shorter and we could make the most of our day at USS.<br />We reached there at around 10.30. Staffs were nice and greeted us politely.<br />We managed to do most of the activities by the end of the day. <br />Our favorite ones were the revenge of the mummy and the transformers ride. The revenge of the mummy ride is more intense but also much more thrilling. <br />We arrived at the Shrek attraction at noon. As the weather was hot and humid, we bought delicious vanilla ice creams at the stall just opposite to the castle.<br />In the afternoon we went for Elmo's tv time show which was mostly for young children. The show was beautifully performed in a comfortable air-conditioned hall.<br />In short, we enjoyed each second spent at the park and we will definitely come back.","","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/1a/ae/5a/6c/transformers-the-ride.jpg

It must be said that the park itself - whilst held aloft by a number of truly exceptional rides - is actually quite small... and lacks the depth of thrill rides that one would find at say a Six Flags park in the US. <br /><br />That said, the rides at the upper echelon of this park are sensational. The first we attacked was Transformers... and what an experience that was. After lining up for 20 odd minutes (even with express passes), this ride did not disappoint. Dizzying video animation, combined with a moving cart makes for a truly unique experience. Hard to explain how effectively stomach-churning some of the 'drops' were... even though you knew the sensation was mostly created by video screens. An absolute must.<br /><br />After that, I (the others were too scared) braved the Battlestar Galactica: Cylon roller coaster. Just. WOW. As the veteran of many theme parks in my time, this suspended coaster is right up there with the world's best and is - for mine - THE must-do ride in the park. Worth the price of admission alone. The acceleration up the initial climb, and subsequent drop is utterly unbelievable... and the fast loop towards the end of the ride (where you dive into the excavated trench - was sublime. It was so good that I made a point of lining up again, towards the end of the day, just to experience it one more time before leaving. Just as good the second time. Top 3 best coasters I've been on, ever.<br /><br />I also took a ride on Battlestar Galactica: Human coaster with my 11 year old daughter. Was actually surprised how good this one was too, even without any loops or rolls. The speed (it's slightly faster than Cylon) and tight turns were hair-raising... and we had an absolute blast, laughing and whooping all the way.<br /><br />The other ride of mention here is the Jurassic Park Rapids Adventure. Despite the lengthy queue (even with express passes, we still needed to line up for 40+ minutes), our whole family thought this was particularly great, and ended up suitably soaked afterwards. Not exactly a thrill ride (although the last bit was definitely thrilling for the kids), but a great family experience.<br /><br />Other than that, the depth of quality rides thins out a tad. Still plenty to do for younger kids, but not so much so, for those seeking mass adrenaline release (even though what is there, is very, very good). In all, we enjoyed our day out and would recommend it for other families, when in Singapore.","","0","","Written January 19, 2020","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

Boy was I wrong about that. Minimum 45 mins to 1.5hrs for each ride is just ridiculous, especially when you have young kids who are just beside themselves standing waiting in the heat. Almost unbearable. <br />The food we had at the diner was horrific. Small, dry barely edible hamburgers.<br />The park itself is ok, but there is no way I'm going back unless I had an Express Ticket. Nothing worse than standing in a line for an hour only to watch someone wanted down next to you in the express line and jump straight on a ride. Without an express pass you barely get to go on any rides.","","0","","Written January 19, 2020","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

Then your guide takes you into the park and has a day planned out for rides and shows. <br /><br />After the shows you are also given priority to have photos with the characters. <br /><br />You have the choice of an hour or half an hour lunch break and all this means is that the time with your guide is suspended and concludes after lunch. Included in your VIP ticket is $25 each for food and beverages at most places around the park. <br /><br />You get 4 hours with your guide, but we were lucky enough to get an extra 50 minutes. <br />After your time has ended you have express passes for the rides and when you show your VIP ticket you get 10% off merchandise. <br /><br />This was well worth every cent spent to purchase these tickets just to avoid the lines.","Family","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/1a/a1/1e/61/dsc-1302-2-largejpg.jpg

Мы покупали экспресс-проход, поэтому до обеда всё обошли, вышли за территорию пообедать пельмешками (рядом со входом в парк есть ресторан сети Din Tai Fung - там ооооочень вкусно! их по городу 20 заведений - обязательно зайдите) и вернулись, чтобы по второму разу посетить те аттракционы, которые особо понравились. Очень довольны, что купили Экспресс-проход - надо заранее покупать, онлайн. Потому что ""день в день"" может не быть - их продают ограниченное количество, чтобы очередь не превышала 10-15 минут (по обычной очереди на Мумию и Трансформеры была очередь 50-60 минут). К слову, система отметок Экспресс-билетов очень странная - думали, будут считывать штрих-код, но нет - контролер просто ручкой вычеркивал аттракцион, который посещен (по экспресс-проходу только один раз можно пройти). То есть, гипотетически можно было сделать по 2-3 распечатки купленного Экспресса. Или несколько раз распечатать один Экспресс и по нему ходить всей семьей)))) <br />Нет нужды бронировать на входе шкафчик на день за 15 синг долларов - на большинстве аттракционов при входе есть шкафы, где можно оставить рюкзак, шлепки, очки... На ""мумии"" - шкафы с отпечатком пальца, по которому бесплатно закрываются вещи на 40 минут. Если больше - доплата 1 или 2 доллара. <br />Добирались до Юниверсал парка прямым автобусом с Орчард Роуд (123 номер, 2,5 дол с человека), обратно на монорельсе бесплатно до станции метро, там купили единоразовый билет на проезд (2,2 снг доллара) и уже в аэропорт поехали. В общем, рекомендуем!!! Желательно для посещения выбирать будний день - мы были в четверг, очереди терпимые (с онлайн-билетами сразу заходите, без кассы), после обеда уже и на крутых аукционах обычные очереди были по 15-20 минут.","","0","","Written January 16, 2020","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

Your heart is beating so fast after this ride! <br /><br />The other amazing rides here that are not to be missed are the Mummy ride, the experience from Steven Speilberg, Shek, etc. There are a number of restaurants inside Universal if you get hungry, which you will, considering you will be spending a good amount of time there. <br /><br />One of the best attractions of Sentosa islands, Universal Studios is not to be missed.

The attendants to the rides were very rude, did not bother to answer to questions asked by the visitors. One ride after a 75 minute wait had a ""technical"" failure which they were unable to tell how long it will take to resolve. Just imagine having waited with your 75 year plus parents for the ride for that long - only to be told - you can chose to enjoy other rides!!! I think this place is designed to work only in a happy path scenario of handling regular load, they cannot deal with heavy volumes. FYI - this is the 3rd Universal i visited after LA and Florida (Those were visited on long weekends as well), but they had much better crowd management abilities.

If you don’t mind spend more money , you might consider to buy additional express ticket to skip the queue. The price might be higher when the demand is higher. I was quite surprised seeing a lot of tourists bought $120 and $140 express tickets, which that is the price around 11 am. Price might go higher later. <br /><br />Child still wanted to play but we decided to left around 5 pm and got taxi easily and quite fast.

No need to comment about the attractions because they are amazing, however, some tip might come handy:<br />- eat before you go in. You’ll be starving anyway if you try to go event half of the attraction, but if you already eat outside, you might not by so much inside, because the price is very high in my view. <br />- lots of water fountain, you can sip.

Um pouco menor que a de Orlando porém com atrações excelentes. Compramos o Fast pass com receio de estar lotado o parque pois fomos em um domingo de sol e conseguimos ir em todas as atrações. Não sei se foi azar, mas as filas não estavam tão grandes assim... a de maior espera girava em torno de 1 hora. De qualquer forma o fast pass nos deu tranquilidade de não ficar correndo de uma atração a outra para conseguir fazer tudo. Acho que valeu a pena! Para dias de parque cheio, o fast pass, vale demais !!!  Nos horários em que os personagens se apresentavam para fotos, havia sempre um funcionário ao lado para tirar as fotos com a câmera do visitante... muito legal para quem quer guardar a recordação da família junta !!!

Anyway best option is the Sentoza express. Now for the park. The MOST IMPORTANT tip i can give:Buy the skip-the line ticket.Its not difficult to get in Universal studios but if you get the normal one you will have a very hard time to get in the rides or other attractions since the lines pile up to even 70-90mins of waiting time.That was my only negative but is something that exists in places like this.Very nice experience that will ring familiar to people that have grown up with films like Jurassic park and Shrek and know what battlestar galactica is .You can get in and just walk around and you will still feel it was worth it.","Couples","0","","Written January 6, 2020","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

The best thing i did was that i also purchased the Express Pass which helped me to beat the long queues of approx 90-100 mins to 20-25 mins. Generally with Express pass one tends to get into rides immediately. Please do remember to do Transporter ride as it is a Must ride. Also do remember to also attend the WaterWorld Show at 1530/1730. Pls do remember to carry water bottles as you can use them and refill them at various locations. Remember to reach early at the venue 0930-1000. Toilets too are available throughout the park. Pls carry sunscreen, caps & shades to beat the sun. Be prepared to walk a lot and wear comfortable walking shoes. For Waterworld show if you sit in front, there are chances that you might get wet. If possible do carry sandwiches with you for energy booster. Ticket Prices & Universal Express Pass are expensive. Express Pass should only be purchased during peak tourist season.

However what was disappointing to me was that I waited between 30 to 90 minutes before every single ride. This meant I only managed to do a few rides and missed out on several rides I wanted to do. This was despite arriving early on what I hoped would be a quiet day. They let so many people in that if you don't have the Express Pass you will spend the majority of your time just waiting in queues for up to 90 minutes. This was so offputting that I would not recommend this theme park unless you are willing to pay for the ticket plus the Express Pass add on. If you want to go you need to weight up your options between (a) buying the Express Pass and hopefully getting your money;s worth or (b) consider not going at all and do other activities within Singapore that are better use of your money and time. If you are willing to risk skipping the Express Pass option, at least try and get in as early as possible and do your research beforehand so you do the popular rides first before the queues build up then do the least popular rides later.","","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/1a/7c/43/50/me-posing.jpg

Worse is in certain situations the express queues were longer(!).<br /><br />Secondly, USS needs to think about the footfall. Clearly, in order to make money, they do not cap the number of guests whom the tiny, little USS park can accommodate. What we saw was a clear failure of USS to deliver the experience tourists come for. <br /><br />Lastly, the rides were shut mid-day on account of some drizzle. I totally understand that it is for our safety. But then there was no clarity on when they will start the rides. As a result, a lot of people were stuck in stuffy rooms trying to get a chance to ride. Looking at their sufferings and total lack of clarity from USS on when the rides will resume, I felt that I should NOT have come to this place at all. It is not the money which i lost (which ofcourse I feel bad about) but what i saw in those waiting rooms that made me feel far more worse.<br /><br />My piece of advice to anyone who is reading this and plan to visit USS, Singapore. Please avoid this place. There are better adventure parks elsewhere, they may offer a better bang for the buck - BUT CLEARLY THIS IS NOT THE PLACE.","","0","","Written January 2, 2020","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

It was one of the worst experience of my life. My family( consisting of two teens) had to wait for a min of 1hr for one ride. We arrived at 10 and the place was so crowded. We could do only three to four rides as the waiting hour didn’t allow us to do more. On top of everything, if we wanted to have an express card which meant not waiting, we had to have a separate budget for it! Never have we waited so much n this has tested our patience!

We'll never return!","3 years ago we did Universal Studios Hollywood on a July weekday. Crowded but not overwhelming. Universal Studios Singapore on the 30th of December was pretty bad!  We knew it would be crowded but had to go while the cousins were visiting. We shouldn't have!  It was ridiculously crowded. We assumed we could just buy express passes for the day. Splurge on the fast pass. But when we went to buy the express pass it turned out to be more than DOULBE the cost of the ticket to get in. So we didn't buy them. But then spent the day irritated at the express pass line. ha ha.  Because they'd put the express pass people on 2 or 3 full coasters before loading the regular lane. EVERY ride was 2 hours or more. It was ridiculous. Sometimes we are at theme parks where the best ride is that long, but yesterday was just frustrating. Nothing felt worth the long lines. 2.5 hours for transformers. A really cool ride that we love, but by the end of 2.5 hours in line, nobody cares anymore. Everyone is tired and irritated. The ride doesn't feel quite as cool after THAT long of a wait. The whole experience was made even more irritating because the times on the map on the APP were totally off. The times at the rides were often off. Many rides posted times a good 20 minutes LESS than the time it actually took. On the map on the APP it would say 30 minutes. So we ran to ride Human. It took 80 minutes. Human is NOT worth 80 minutes. It's a regular rollercoaster. SO not worth a long wait. Cylon rollercoaster was AWESOME and is worth a long wait. We waited 2 hours and had SO much fun on it, it made the wait feel almost worth it. Human was NOT worth it!  The kids were excited all day to go on Jurassic Park. We waited all day for the line to go down. Even at 8:30pm it was still a 100 minute wait and so it was going to have to be the last ride. The kids were disappointed to not ride but opted to go ride a couple of other rides instead of waiting so long yet AGAIN, for just that 1 ride. We did about 4 rides in 8 hours. At 2:30pm we tried to stop for lunch. Every place completely packed so we got corndogs at a stand. At about 5:45 we finally stopped to get some real food. In Jurassic Park area my brother had gone an hour earlier to find and save us tables and we ate potato wedges and chicken satays that were actually quite good. And we got to sit for a while. We never did get to see Madagascar land or minion land or shrek land. We didn't get to go to any shows. Because we spent ALL DAY in lines.  The expresspass price at this park increases as more express passes sell. In other words, it's affordable if you are the first ones to buy the expresspass for that date. But if you wait until a few days before, it becomes ridiculously expensive. It is definitely NOT an amusement park worth hundreds of dollars! The firework show at the end was really nice. Well done! The APP is terrible. the lines were NOT worth it. As others have said, only go to this park on a weekday during off season. It's just not worth it on a holiday. Also, it was really annoying that they never had single rider lane open. I'm not sure why not???? i thought maybe there was a good reason until I was looking at the ""rollercoaster"" pictures of several rides after we'd ridden them and noticed that every coaster car would have several empty seats. And they weren't filling them with single riders???  strange!  AND the workers were NOT loading people into lanes, for quick loading of the rides. The ride would pull up and unload and the workers were just then ushering people into lanes. Then loading them. it would all go a lot faster if they had people in lanes READY to load right when the coaster car pulled up and emptied. Like other theme parks we've visited. And having fast passes like Disney or a functioning APP would be great. We live in JB across the border in Malaysia and thought about buying a season pass. We will definitely NOT be doing that!","","0","","Written December 31, 2019","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

For that reason, this was a unique experience. The staff were mostly friendly. <br />Getting there was convenient and the surrounding resort has a lot of options. <br />That said, the guest experience is particularly lacking due to structural issues (especially regarding their queue system). <br /><br />It's clear that Universal Studios Singapore places a greater emphasis on its profit margin than it does on guest experience; this is not surprising (it's a business after all) but notable considering the effort its competitor (Disney parks, specifically) places on ensuring its guests don't feel gipped and get their money's worth. <br /><br />Wait Times: Expect to wait at least 40 minutes for each ride, even if the wait time displayed is significantly less. The display is almost never accurate and sometimes feels deliberately misleading. Here's an example: <br /><br />The Mummy ride showed a wait time of 25 minutes. Locker rentals nearby are free for 45 minutes, and at least $4 once that's exceeded. Thinking we'd be able to make it in and out of The Mummy in time, we placed our possessions in the locker and immediately went into the line. <br />The wait ended up being an hour long, and we ultimately had to pay to get our items out of the locker. <br />--<br /><br />The 'skip the line' pass they sell on top of the admission ticket to the park is the only real way to avoid the long waits. Unfortunately due to every single ride having an express line, non-express users are completely screwed regardless of what they want to do, and there's no reliable way to efficiently maximize your time. <br /><br />--<br /><br />Attractions are average and generic; the Puss in Boots Giant Journey ""roller coaster"" (it does not deserve being called such) was particularly disappointing.<br />Food inside the park was overpriced; you'd be much better off exiting the park and eating somewhere else in the Sentosa resort. <br /><br />--<br />Ultimately, this is a park you don't need to revisit once you've experienced it. Until they rework their queue system so that guests don't feel like second-class citizens if they don't pay the premium skip the line feature, I think I've got the gist of the place and won't be returning.","","0","","Written December 31, 2019","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

Only for those with low expectations and who don't mind queueing in the heat!<br />We had a pre-purchased pass and had to queue for about 30 minutes at guest services to redeem (although the queue to actually buy tickets was much worse). <br />Just a short 10 minute queue to actually then get in where you find gift shop after gift shop interspersed with over iced food and drink outlets before eventually getting to rides and attractions. They put up an estimate of wait time for each, with almost all 60 minutes plus, and the worst 120 minutes. I don't care how good a 90 second ride is, I am not going to queue for two hours for it!<br />All rides have Express queues, but the sale price of an express pass seems to be demand driven. The brochure mentioned $30 but the actual selling price of express passes when we were there was $160 per person. This to me seems like gouging!<br />Universal Studios seems to epitomise Sentosa, seemingly designed by an accountant on a box ticking exercise. Yes it has rides, themes, souvenirs and food and drink, but it is small, congested and poor! It might be ok at some time when it's quiet, but personally I would avoid it like the plague.

However today if I said it was terrible would be an understatement. The price has rapidly increased which I was disgusted by how much it cost for the 3 of us for an express pass in which we still had to wait up to an hour in the queues. Yes I understand that it is a busy time period as it is holidays and new years around the corner however at least limit the number of people buying these passes. In 4 hours we managed to complete 4 rides with this “express pass” however it really doesn’t sound like one.

It’s Christmas and school holidays so we expected Universal to be busy. However we didn’t expect two out of the first four rides we tried to be closed with maintenance issues ( both opened later with massive queues); food stalls lacking basic provisions; tired and rundown finish on buildings and footpaths; queues of over 140 minutes for certain rides. We paid SG$960 (usd700)  for four adult tickets including unlimited fast pass. (We tried to buy them online to get residents’ and student discounts but none of the selections fitted our situation, so after queuing for 30 mins we had to pay full price for all).We were there seven hours and went on seven attractions. Is this good value? Not in my book. <br /><br />A lot of external fittings are showing their age and corrosion is rife in many areas. I would like to assume that vital systems are better maintained. <br /><br />The restaurant we went to essentially threw the cold (supposed to be hot) food at us. Staff had no interest in discussing issues, due either to limited English or a lack of interest.. We live in Singapore and had not been to Universal for years, due to relative mediocrity last time. After this experience, not only will we not return, but we will now also advise others to avoid, hence this post. If you must visit: 1. Buy tickets online if you can; 2. Avoid any holiday. 3. Check maintenance schedule; 4. Probably avoid fast pass purchase; 5. Have low expectations; 6. Watch the Waterworld show, as it almost rescues the previous six hours..<br /><br />Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me.

We experienced in 4 hours just 4 activities, as all other ones came with waiting times of 45 min up to 70 min, which we did not want to endure. Once inside the park, we realised that there are two categories of customers. Those with normal tickets and those with express tickets, which get priority in the queues. We were not told at the cashier about this, but it‘s definitely recommended under such circumstances. However,  you have to pay then 160 S$ per ticket. Besides this, we got cold food at the food court, for 13 S$ per meal. Last but not least, one of the rides was closed and they could not tell when it will open again. When we complained about the overall experience at the guest service, the lady just listened and nodded. On the positive side, the shows are professionally performed and the whole scenery is well done.

Unfortunately, this experience leaves much to be desired and it will be a long time before I choose to return again.<br /><br />We purchased tickets from the Changi Rewards website, which had to be exchanged upon arrival to USS. The signposting is poor, compounded by the sheer number of visitors to the park obscuring what limited signage there is.<br /><br />We queued up for 40 minutes before finally exchanging our vouchers for passes. I can only imagine how long people who were in line were waiting for - there were at least 10-12 rows about 40-50 people deep.<br /><br />We got to the Battlestar Galactica: Cylon ride where we waited for 90 minutes in the standard queue before getting onto the ride. The ride itself was fine, and not dissimilar to how it was when the park first opened.<br /><br />Stopped for a quick toilet break after and the toilets left much to be desired. Broken toilet seats and wet floors - not exactly an impression of consistent and clean maintenance.<br /><br />Unfortunately the theme of maintenance does not appear to be a strong suit here. We moved on to the Mummy ride next and where the USS experience continued to disappoint. We waited for 57 minutes in a sweltering queue with very limited air conditioning or even ventilation, only to be told that the ride had to be “urgently evacuated”, leaving a throng of disgruntled visitors. <br /><br />We are currently in line for the Jurassic Park Rapids ride ... with a wait time of 2 hours.<br /><br />Clearly USS is aware of the exceedingly excessive wait times as it has introduced both express and express unlimited passes. These are quite pricey and we’re listed for SGD$110 and SGD$140 on the day of our visit. Even so, the express lines on the day of our visit were not much shorter - maybe an hour or so less than the regular line and it was clear from the disappointed looks on the express pass holders that this was not the premium experience they had paid for. <br /><br />Having been to Universal Studios Japan in June 2019, which undeniably has greater drawcard attractions like Harry Potter World and provided a fantastic experience, it seems a let-down that USS cannot provide anywhere close to a similar experience. Yes the wait times for popular rides at USJ were at times comparable (we waited 2 hours at the start of the day for the Harry Potter ride), but these wait times were remarkably reduced towards the late afternoon and there was always a sense of calm ensuring visitor comfort whilst waiting  for each ride.There were also many more food carts and kiosks to stock up on whilst waiting. There were unfortunately more closed kiosks/carts than open on the day we visited. <br /><br />USS provides a far inferior experience and its infrastructure and commitment to a positive visitor experience appears to have succumbed to the pressures of maximising visitor numbers, with no regard to how it can actually service these guests.<br /><br />All in all, it is a resounding disappointment not only from myself but from a friend visiting from overseas who remembers USS from better days.<br /><br />Would advise skipping it unless you are prepared to spend the money for an express pass, and have the patience to wait in lengthy queues under hot and uncomfortable conditions. <br />","Friends","0","","Written December 28, 2019","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

Universal Studios is now available in several locations around the world and I can only compare with that Florida (Orlando) park which is significantly larger and more varied in its content - but there is also much the same. As a 10-year-old, this is the heavenly realm of fun, fun, fun! As an adult, you also have a lot of exchange, but maybe also get tired of all the sounds and slightly over-ambitious exposures of different film themes ...

The rides are very average , the place so packed that even after Express Pass one can expect a wait time of 100 mins for each ride. In some of the rides the Express queue was longer than a normal queue. Nothing much for the toddlers. The slightest of drizzle and all the rides are suspended. Within the premises also along side almost all rides, one has to take lockers on rent (with rentals as high as 4 SGD per ride). Above all, our new iPhone was stolen during our visit. Seems pickpockets frequent this place. So be careful with your gadgets and money.<br /><br />Overall, a very disappointing experience. Can be easily avoided with no regrets. Places like Hong Kong Ocean Park is better in terms of quality of rides, pricing and management.","Family","0","","Written December 26, 2019","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

Когда мы зашли внутрь, у меня аж глаза прослезились. Очень красивые декорации, сделано все классно, музыка, атмосфера... Билеты на двоих на сайте обошлись в 159 долларов. Можно купить заранее, можно купить на месте. Мы побоялись очереди в кассу, по факту она была не большая. Есть совсем детские аттракционы, есть для любителей острых ощущений (американские горки). Представление Водный мир поразил!!! Просто топчик, жаль, что не снимали!!! Лучше перед шоу снять обувь и надеть дождевик, тоже самое касается, если идти на карусель с динозаврами по реке. Там продают, если нет своего. Лайфхак для тех, кто не боится на пару минут разлучиться со своим спутником, идти вдвоем в очередь для одного. Возможно, даже посадят в кабинку для двоих, но это не точно, зато очереди можно обойти. Идти на целый день!

We were welcomed into the VIP reception and offered cold drinks and was introduced to our guide for the day Cassandra. Our VIP tickets had pictures of Minions on which I had put down as a request for a meet and greet. It was little touches like this that helped make our day. Cassandra offered us a map of the park and explained what we would do in the tour and booked our meet and greet sessions. Cassandra explained that another family might join us (as the tour can have up to 12 people) however we weren't phased by this. Our first part was only the 3 of us and then the other family joined us.<br /><br />The VIP Experience allowed us to walk straight onto the rides, even rides that aren't included in the unlimited express tickets. We were the first to do our meet and greets - we choose Transformers and Minions. The tickets included unlimited passes so after the tour finished we were able to choose which rides we wanted to back onto plus a $25 meal voucher per person.<br />We went on 9 rides plus the adults were offered the opportunity to go onto the Battlestar Galactica. There was a VIP room at the Waterworld show which was welcoming with a cold drink. I highly recommend the pizzas at the Italian place, they are huge and filled our family of 3.<br />We had booked the 10am tour and it finished at 4pm as the guide has an hour lunch break during the day.<br />Cost wise it worked out only slightly more expensive than purchasing the entry ticket, unlimited pass plus the $25 per person food. The ticket was slightly discounted due to a promotion they had on if you pay for the VIP tickets via a Mastercard.<br />We truly had a fantastic day and I would highly recommend the VIP experience.","","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/1a/63/59/89/the-park-was-decorated.jpg

Must go rides at Universal: Revenge of Mummy.<br />Battlestar Galactica<br />Transformers the ride.<br />Jurassic Park Rapid adventures (you get wet in this ride so you may buy raincoat for 3$ at the spot or pay 5$ for drying pod where 4 can get in at a time.

However, if you didn't pay for this pass (which is the majority of tourists), you're stuck in line watching these guys skip the line over and over again before your line has even moved one person.<br /><br />There were regular, unexplained delays in the rides with no warning on how long the wait time would be for the ride to be operational again. <br /><br />The attractions are so outdated... For example, the Waterworld special effects show... Not only is Waterworld a terrible movie to begin with, but it's from 1995! Families with young children wouldn't even know this movie. Then there's the Battlestar Galactica rollercoasters - sure it was a relatively popular Sci-Fi show in 2004, however, that's 15 years ago... Not appealing to the young audience of children who frequent the park.<br /><br />Then there's the locker scam. Sure, the lockers are free for a certain time period when you go on a ride, but you may end up paying more money if you get stuck in a line for hours and can't decide if it's worth the sacrifice to leave the line or stay in it since you've been there for so long.<br /><br />Oh, and we went on a Monday and spent the whole day in lines, only riding 4 attractions... Apparently weekends are even worse...<br /><br />Overall, don't bother! It's not value for money and there are better things to see and do with your time in Singapore.","","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/1a/58/d0/c0/so-crowded.jpg

Even on weekdays the wait times are between 10 minutes to 1 hour.

Plan to spend an entire day here, and avoid weekends if possible.<br /><br />This time we traveled with a 2.5-year old. There are many rides and events for kids who can’t sit on the big rides. The Madagascar and Shrek rides, Spielberg’s hurricane set, the smaller rides at the Lost World are all massive fun. There are tons more things to do for toddlers and little kids, so don’t worry if you are taking little ones!<br /><br />Carry lots of water and some food.

I was expecting maybe there would be some new rides or maybe at least some Of the shows they will change it but it is exactly the same. <br /><br />The park is not that big to be honest and if this is your first time then you will probably enjoy the experience there. But if you have visited before and experience all the rides and shows, then it will be kind of boring because it’s the same thing. <br /><br />The transformers ride is excellent and fun. Too bad they are still using the same story and did not change it with another new storyline. The outdoor roller coaster was closed which is a disappointment. We wants to with the waterworld stunt show which starts at 3.30pm but it was cancelled due to the weather which was going to rain. That’s another disappointment. I think they should start the show earlier. Why must you start so late at 3.30pm? You should have a few shows throughout the day starting in the morning. <br /><br />Overall i would say this is just above average If you have visited it before. And it will be a good rating if you are there for the first time. <br /><br />I think it’s time for the Mgmt to start thinking about perhaps changing things a bit to give your customers a surprise and something new to look forwards to. <br /><br />","Friends","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/1a/55/4b/e3/photo3jpg.jpg

The workers seem to dread being there. They looked jaded and are engaged in their own conversation. One even mentioned that she is changing job is she finds the work ‘monotonous’. Save a few good ones, USS should seriously look into the morale of their staff or else.

I had the chance to visit Universal Studios Hollywood and it was huge! 1 day is not enough. Here in SG, 1 day is enough. There are lots of attractions inside that were also not present / not available in Hollywood the time I visited last year. So for instance, I enjoyed the Transformers 3D because I didn't get the chance to do that before. Not all rides were the same so I really enjoyed the Rides & Attractions as well here in SG. Planning ahead on what to do is really important to maximize the visit. Me and my sis did skip just a few rides that we're really scared of but we almost rode everything. And since we skipped some, we were able to do more of the Meet & Greet events, as well as the Shows available. It was also a great time to visit since it's Christmas season and most shows were themed with Christmas Vibes. There were probably just 1-2 Shows and Meet & Greets that we were not able to take photos with due to cutoff times (after we lined up also, for a little bit). The fan mists were not working and could've probably been turned off instead. It was not that hot but it was still humid, despite a few times it drizzled that day of our visit. Good thing it didn't rain that much, unlike the previous day we were in SG. However, it could be better if more fans were turned on. Best also for visits to happen on weekdays. It was still packed when we visited (on a Wednesday) and at times, we still had to use our ""Universal Express Tickets"" (we bought separately) since there are queue lines - like at the Transformers Attraction, The Pandages Theatre (showing Elmo Time when we visited - lotsa kids & families), Jurrasic park attractions, among others. It could've been better as well if all attractions were following the policies on Universal Express. There were times wherein they treated those with Express and those without it, as same. Like at the ""Lights, Camera ..."" they made us all line up the same even if we had the Express Ticket and it was accepted there supposedly. My sis had the chance to perform with the dancers of the ""Rhythm Truck"" performance. We knew some of them from home - The Streetboys (which I believe is now called The Rockafellas?) and it was amazing! The closing show we saw (""The Christmas Invention"") was a spectacular attraction as well! All the popular characters were dancing, there were lots of light shows, lotsa dancing and props ... it was a great feat to cap the night! Me and my sis really enjoyed it!","","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/38/72/b5/universal-entrance-dec.jpg

It was a cloudy day, so the weather was perfect! I was expecting the park to be busy as it is the school holidays in Singapore and the weather was good, but I was pleasantly surprised the park wasn't that crowded. I was at Universal Studios Hollywood earlier this year and the wait for rides are usually at least 30 to 40 minutes. The most I had to wait for rides today was 15 minutes. For the Battlestar Galatica, the posted wait time is usually 60 min. But at 5pm, the posted wait time was 5 minutes! I went on Jurassic Park Rapids Adventure in 5 minutes, the posted wait time was 15 minutes.<br /><br />I'm not much into rides so I went on only a few, but there are many shows to watch. The shows were done really well and performers are all very professional. The mascot Julien from Madagascar did a fantastic job. He's an absolute joy to watch! Staff are helpful and friendly. Don't miss the Waterworld show. There was also snow simulation at ""Hollywood"" at every hour. The light snow fall looks real, just like the light flurries in Canada.<br /><br />Download the Universal Studios Singapore app for a listing of shows and ride wait times. <br /><br />Thank you everyone at Universal Studios for making it a fun day for me and most importantly, for my dad.<br />","","0","","Written December 5, 2019","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

Согласитесь будет обидно не успеть посетить какую-либо локацию или аттракцион, а экспресс проход позволяет проходить через отдельный коридор без очереди. Хотя мы были в выходной день и на некоторые аттракционы, даже в экспресс проходе были небольшие очереди. В общем оно того стоит!<br /><br />Ну а когда вы уже там - забудьте обо всем и просто наслаждайтесь всем, что вас окружает... И не забудьте купить сувенир на память)<br /><br />Как добраться:<br />- На такси из любой точки города - просто и быстро, но наиболее затратно.<br />- На общественном транспорте (автобус или метро) доезжаете до станции/остановки VIVO CITY, это торговый центр с одноименным названием. Выходя из ТЦ по пешеходному мосту пешком добираетесь до острова Сентоза (не больше километра) - самый бюджетный вариант.<br />- Чуть подороже - если воспользоваться монорельсом или канатной дорогой.","","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/1a/34/5a/c6/caption.jpg","Written December 4, 2019","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

In fact he hadn't been on a rollercoaster in nearly 20 years, but I was about to change all that with our trip here.<br />In preparation for our day out at USS, we bought the fast-track passes which more than earned their keep as the wait times for some rides were around forty minutes plus. And this was on a Thursday, too! It also meant that my partner didn't have too much time to stop and think before we found ourselves strapped in.<br />Thanks to the fast-track pass (and my powers of persuasion) my partner and I managed to go on nearly every ride, which given his earlier hesitation I found incredible. We worked our way from the Madagascar rides all the way to the dueling Battlestar Galactica roller coasters, and I couldn't have been more proud. Whether it was the magic of being on holiday or a special something about USS, I can't say for certain, but what I do know is that he can't wait to go to another theme park.<br />Seriously, however, I cannot stress the importance of the fast-track pass.","","0","","Written December 1, 2019","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

We arrived at the VIP lounge to be greeted by the lovely Andrew, who proceeded to make me a coffee and my daughter a cold drink, gave us gifts and told us how the day would go. (Contrary to past reviews you can’t miss the lounge, big sign and red carpet gives it away).  We managed to do every ride and were in the front row of every ride. We had plenty of photo ops, including a private session with the Madagascar characters. My daughter (21) even received a proposal from Puss in boots. We chose our lunch spot and Andrew found us a table and minded the bags while we got our lunch. The VIP lounge at Waterworld was heaven. My daughter was getting sunburnt so he got her an umbrella. Looked after our belongings while we were on rides, having photos and shopping. I can not praise us enough. My recommendation spend the dollars you won’t regret it.

Loved the Autobots 3D ride & Water world show... actually they were all good. Would definitely recommend to buy an 'Express' pass before you enter as the normal wait time can be long. We got ours through Klook - see reviews as the ticket redemption booth is tricky to find & you have to redeem before you enter. I recommend to get there early & plan your day before as you can miss some shows or run out of time to go on rides. We decided to prioritise the rides over shows to get our moneys worth from the Express pass. Top get there we travelled by Cable car across seeing lots of Singapore sights from above.","","0","","Written November 26, 2019","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

But that wasn't the case, because the whole atmosphere didn't make me want to spend more.<br /><br />- The park is small, the attractions are small and short<br />- The decorations felt poorly made compared to other theme parks, so the atmosphere was lacking<br />- Most staffs don't seem to bother to entertain the visitors, I mean they are helpful keeping people in order and in line, and that's it. In theme parks, I expect much more, or at least, they should be smiling and making us feel happy<br />- Merchandises are limited and the quality didn't appeal to me. I am a huge Elmo fan, but there wasn't a Elmo merchandise I would like to add to my collection<br />- Food wasn't good either<br /><br />Since they marketed it as ""one-of-its-kind theme park in Asia"", it was very disappointing, because it is extremely far from the truth. There are countless better theme parks in Asia and I expect much much more when it comes to Universal Studios. I think Transformers was the only good memory I have from this visit.<br /><br />Not sure if I want to visit USS again, since travelling to USJ is just as far for me.","","0","","Written November 25, 2019","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

In Sentosa Island, we also find the ""themed"" part of the city/country and there the Universal Studios. <br /><br />Wherever I go I always try to visit the theme park and this time I felt like I couldn't miss it. And it didn't disappoint!<br /><br />The ticket is around 40 GBP and I would say that if you go in a weekday and non-holiday, you won't need a fast pass or anything else. <br /><br />It is quite bigger than Disneyland Tokyo, although if you rush it through, you will have finished the main attractions by midday. You will even have time to ride the main ones several times. <br /><br />What surprised me the most was the roller coaster ""Cylone"". I honestly wasn't expecting such an intense ride. I'm a fan of fast rides and so far the only ones that had me satisfied were in Port Aventura (Spain) but here, in Cylone, I found my favourite one. <br /><br />For people that don't love rides so much, the theme is also really nice and there are shows and activities like movies or really soft. <br /><br />Food is not that expensive considering that is a theme park and the whole park is really clean. <br /><br />I loved it.","","0","","Written November 22, 2019","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

This time I was tasked with the same assignment and I thought it would be very boring and monotonous to see the same old things again. <br /><br />As in previous year, we booked the entire Universal Studio for our residents from 6 pm to 11.30 pm. It was school holiday and the response to the ticket sale was overwhelming. All 3000 tickets were completely sold despite the fact that they came here 2 years ago and despite the fact that the price of one admission ticket has increased from $20/- to $30/-. <br /><br />About 70 buses were chartered to ferry the residents from the community center to the attraction. But the discounted ticket came with a price. It is just for a short few hours duration and few of the food outlets and play stations had closed. <br /><br />The Madagascar A Crate Adventure was not open 2 years ago but this time we were lucky to jump into the boat rides and almost got ourselves wet by the raining water.  The captivating and stunning water world performances appeared to me repetitive but I was attracted to a  photo studio where you can choose to put on few of the Korean costumes on display and be photographed. It was fun attired in baggy and brightly colored Korean costumes with my bus `mistresses' in a superimposed beautiful Korean scenery in the background. <br /><br />Unlike 2 years ago where I roamed in solo, this time I decided to walk around with my group of grassroots members. Knowing that the price of the food here is exorbitant, the 10 of us decided to combine all our individual food vouchers and bought for ourselves a big chicken pizza to share.  It was a good idea and everyone enjoyed the `sumptuous' feat of pizza while we laughed and talked happily at the table. <br /><br />Once stomach filled, we proceeded to have some fun with the ride at Sesame Street and watched a spectacular street hip hop dance near the corner. The pulsating music uplifted my spirit  and I almost danced with them. I was attracted to the twirling and whirling Accelerator but a warning risk signage dampened my excitement. I felt regret not participating in the thrill. We wanted to try the Transformers but was discouraged by the 20 minutes queue. <br /><br />We strolled around for a while and took some group photos with some of the cartoon characters before realizing that it was time to stand-by at the departing bus pick-up points for residents.<br /><br />It was a short time spent but it was something different from the last time I came. The attraction seem small but there are many hidden treasures for you to explore. This time I felt happy to be in the company of my members as we explored the place. The last time I went on a solo rushing from one ride to another. <br /><br />Enjoy as a group and treasure that social connection. There is always something refreshing something new in this wonderland.","","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/17/c2/37/scenic.jpg

Oasis Spice Cafe was friendly and good.<br />- Can the fountain be repaired at Sci-Fi city?<br />- Can New York's shopfronts be updated as some stuff has been sun damaged?<br />Incorporate more movie elements. (there is a Gotham reference but Batman is Warner? No?)<br />- Lights, camera, action: can the movie posters be updated please and give it a bit more sparkle. (at least give it a clean)<br />- There is a minion shop but no minion attraction? Minion fountain doesn't work either<br />- The lost world: great show! superb! 10/10! The decor is faded and props are poor. A few screens and a bit of sound goes a long way.<br />- Far Far Away: a small detail: I was expecting the ''Welcome to Duloc animation'' like in the movie. Shrek 4D and Donkey Live was great.<br />The enchanted airways: faded decor, could do with some screens and animation.<br />Puss in boots: great ride but what's up with the story line? Again, faded decor.<br />Madagascar: great decor and nice ride but could do with an animation upgrade.<br />Revenge of the mummy: superb overall. What a great decor, entrance has great atmosphere. A few of the animations didn't work during the ride.<br />Battlestar Galactica: Superb rides! But does anyone know actually the TV series? Is having a theme park not part of Universal Studios to promoted their franchises? <br />Same with Jurassic Park rapid adventure: great ride but it needs updating as there are 5 movies in the franchise by now.<br />Overall, this is a great theme park. It's not gigantic, it's easy to get to and easy to escape. And yes there is a bit of luck involved with the express pass but overal it's worth the extra money.","","0","","Written November 18, 2019","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

Есть разные аттракционы и 2 американские горки, по сравнению например с Порт Авентура в Испании, то менее экстремальные. За 5 часов мы все обошли и получили заряд классного настроения. Что могу порекомендовать: <br /><br />1. На кассе по мимо входного билета взять билет, с которым вы будете проходить быстрее ( 50 дол. На человека ), так как реально он работает. Стоять по 40 минут на горку в жару - это сложно. Мы все проходили за 5 - 10 минут. <br /><br />2. Приехать к 10 открытию, толпа народа появляется после 12. <br /><br />3. На водную карусель в парке юрского периода, пойти без обуви и взять плащ, там его продают. Так как там полностью будете облиты водой, потом нам было не очень комфортно с мокрыми кроссовками ходить пол дня;(.  <br /><br />Хорошо провести время!!!","Couples","0","","Written November 17, 2019","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

Its really cost efficient and no hassle.<br />For USS ticket, express pass and go on non school holiday weekday is definitely what save us this trip from the infamous long queue. Make sure u check the performance and meet and greet session schedule and plan your day around it. Bring water bottles (many free water dispenser available) as drinks can be crazy expensive inside. Meet & greet session about 15min and there are plenty of place where u can take photo with the characters, love the staffs at photography section that helps us tk photo on phone in addition to their official photo, and they didn't charge us if we don't want the photo. Transformer is closed for servicing, which is one major downside for many I believed. The rest of the rides are alright. Enjoyed all the shows without much hassle and queue.

We arrived around 11am which wasn’t too late - and decided to catch all the kids shows before doing all the rides. We started with Elmo at 1230, and some other outdoor shows like turntables etc; then Donkey Live, Waterworld. By the time we were done it was 4. <br /><br />The only scheduled closure was for Transformers. We had saved our express pass UNLIMITED for Puss Inboots, Enchanted Airways etc; but made the mistake of going in Madagascar Crate adventure - whwre there was a technical issue . Since we had the express pass we were right in front of the ride and wasn’t sure if we should leave or stay. In the end the delay was AN HOUR! And by the time we were out it was a mad rush to finish the 2 other coasters Puss and Enchanted Airways. However for some reason Enchanfed Airways was closed!! No reason, nothing. We only managed one coaster before they already closed everything and didn’t allow us to queue for rides from 545pm onwards. This was even though the park was scheduled to close at 6pm. I bought the express pass unlimited for NOTHING.<br /><br />Conclusion; express pass unlimited waste of money. Rides will close for no reason ; and today was all our toddler rides! We’re extremely disappointed by USS and likely will never go again with young kids.","Family","0","","Written November 9, 2019","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

When looking for the entrance of ""revenge of the mummy ride"", I didn't notice there was a photo-taking area where didn't have any sign or rails, and walked one step into the photo maybe. A female staff who was using her i-phone taking the photos screamed madly to stop me. Even around the noisy, her voice was so loud that made my ear hurting. I could have shouted back, but instead, I apologized and turned around. I didn't want to waste any time on it. But that made me very upset.  Maybe, she thought she had been the servant of the Egyptian queen for too long so she had the right to shout to people? I hope not that stupid. <br /><br />The facility is good.

Big bags were checked. Bottles of mineral water were allowed but one can fill his water bottle from fountains around the park. Water wasn’t cold though and considering that it is always hot in Singapore, one is better off bringing ice cold water in their jugs. <br />There are shows and attractions for young kids, teens and older people but Harry Potter is glaringly missing. But my grandson had the time of his life and the trip to Singapore was worth it.<br />Food inside the park is expensive so we decided to eat dinner outside as soon as we were done. <br />Spending the whole day in USS when crowds are not too dense maximises the satisfaction gained.","Family","0","","Written November 6, 2019","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

Our second one now. That’s how much our child loves USS. He started taking rides like the Mummy, Human and Cylon. Rather troublesome as we needed to put everything in the locker before going up. If only they have little shelves like all the other rides, where riders can choose to place their bags nearby before riding and get them immediately after riding. <br />We bought a day pass ticket to upgrade to season pass. The day pass in the past had a food voucher for $5, but now it’s retail voucher and a coke drink from any food court. Food voucher is preferred and the limitation of where the drinks can be purchased in slightly limiting and troublesome. Hope the drinks can be claimed fr any drink stall. And the food voucher will be better if possible, than drink voucher. :)","Family","0","","Written November 5, 2019","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

I was so shocked and enraged by her rude behaviour. There should be an announcement to the guests, get the 3D glasses before entering the so called “Torturing Dungeon”.  We are not tortured by the dungeon but pissed off by the rudeness of the said staff.<br />There was no proper ushered & direction. Guests bunched into the dungeon until announcement been made reminding to wear the 3D glasses for the show. The other scenario was guests are been hurrying in other words chased away when the meet and greet session has end its showtime. Definitely guests especially with children excited to take pictures of their favourite characters. But sadly they’ve been chased away unprofessionally. Is that how you treat your guests. To me these staff are not capable to work in amusement park industry. To work in a amusement park, you should be energetic, lively, cheerful and friendly to the guests. Not the other way round. <br />In addition, the management of universal studios singapore should have a training session of their staff on how to improve a guests customers orientated satisfaction. The management should take seriously into the comfort of the guests while waiting and exhausted situation for the long queue at each park. Should have placed a giant mist fan, blowers and bench as your guests comprises a range of ages. Especially to the senior citizens and with small children. And also to look into how to resolve on the exhausted long queue issues. To create more lane perhaps or what not?<br />Anyway, we had a great time enjoying the hyper realistic 3D thrill ride of the “Transformer”.<br />","Family","0","","Written November 5, 2019","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

For smaller kids I think shows and merry go rounds are there. we went on a weekday during Diwali time and still got a lot of crowd. Would highly recommend to invest in the express pass to make best use of time and cover all rides in case going to weekend or holidays especially with impatient kids. Constraints on some rides are based on height and dimensions and health.<br /><br />Some tips:<br />1. One ride at Jurassic park is a wet ride, you can get drenched, so carry change of clothes or buy the transparent raincoats called ponchos for 5SD if you don’t like to walk around all wet. Noon time is pretty hot here so better to be wet at this time. Also shoes will get soaked so wear flip flops or remove shoes.<br />2. Don’t spend too much time clicking pics or buying souvenirs initially as you may not have time for rides. Also note it closes sharp at 6pm and you tend to be bit tired by 4-5pm after all the rides, best time to walk slow and take pics. Whole place can be covered well within half hr on foot.<br />3. At first hoping you are early, Walk around , check and prioritise those rides which you like the most and have smaller queues and wait times. <br />4. Some rides can have as long as 2hrs wait time like the galactica red and grey track and transformer so walk further from entrance and try and hit these rides first instead of going left to right along the circle which is what most of the crowd will be doing. Also most of the crowd will be clicking pics on entry so earlier the better to hit these rides.<br />5. The shows are at fixed times and not all shows are great. Research what you like and time the shows well ahead to ensure you don’t miss them. I liked the waterworld show, you can get wet here if you are in soak zone, would recommend to see the 12.15pm show. In the evening the entire crowd goes to see this amazing live stunt show with fire and guns and there will be no queues hopefully at the rides for a good 45mins which you can Utilise to your benefit. Take seats in this show as per your preference of getting wet or not.<br />6. For some rides you have to keep your bags in locker so travel as light as possible.<br />7. Carry hats umbrellas and sunglasses as place is very hot. At Roll-a-coaster like rides ensure you are not carrying or wearing at loose articles on you, like caps, mobiles, chains/necklaces, slippers etc. secure them well or remove them. Dress comfortably for the rides and hot weather.<br />8. Avoid rides which cause nausea immediately post lunch. Hit some shows or slow rides at this time.<br />9. Avoid lunch during peak times from 12 to 2pm, queues will less during this time, enjoy your rides instead.<br />10. Free Toilets are there. Also free drinking water is available at many points so carry your bottles.<br />11. The handlers of the rides are few and don’t rush in my opinion for ensuring all safety measures of the people on the rides are meet, so queues move a little slow. Also people having  express pass get first priority and no wait time at all so another reason why queues move slow.","Family","0","","Written October 31, 2019","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

Never thought of visiting USS until today when i had some guest showed up from overseas.. After reading through all the 1 star comments, I decided to take Normal standard ticket via online without Express pass.<br /><br />As a work pass holder i was able to buy it for $69 others on $75 rates.<br /><br />We decided to visit today (30th Nov 2019 Wednesday). Not Weekend. Not Holiday season at least for local school or nearby counties. <br /><br />Only risk was that we Singapore are notorious when it comes to rain. We started from North of Singapore it was already raining here. But fortunately Rain Gods favored us and moved the spell away from South and USS was safe.. None of the rides was cancelled. Rain in North gave us some good shade and cool breeze during the whole day.<br /><br />Entry to USS.<br /><br />- Got the Sentosa Express from VivoCity level 3. Payed $6 two way journey using MRT Card.<br />- We arrived around 2:30pm lol. (Horribly late on purpose to avoid morning rush hour Q. We had bought tickets online)<br />- Went straight to entry point, scanned email and got in. (they did not check bags for food or water) We had none anyways inside our backbag.<br />- Entry Q time 0mins<br /><br />1st Ride ""Madagascar A Crate Adventure""<br />- I was quite new to Roller coasters. so through we would start with something easy.<br />- Reached the Ride around 2:36pm. Got Ride at 2:42pm<br />- Waiting time: 6mins<br />- Thrill Level:- Beginners <br />- Ok for all kids <br />- No Need for Locker facility. They let you carry small bags.<br /><br />2nd Ride ""Enchanted Airways""<br />- Entered Queue around 3:08pm. Got ride around 3:26pm. Waiting time:18mins.<br />- Thrill Level:- Ok for Beginners<br />- Ok for Kids - i could see many kids on this ride :)<br />- No Need for Locker facility. They let you carry small bags.<br /><br />3rd Ride ""Shrek 4D Adventure""<br />- Please pass this if you do not have express pass as its a waste of time. But if you got kids with you, they would love it. If you are a thrill seeker, please pass this one without regret.<br />- No Need for Locker facility. They let you carry small bags.<br /><br />4th Ride ""Puss in Boots Giant Journey""<br />- Mini roller coaster ride.<br />- Entry time 4:03pm, Got Ride 4:10pm Waiting time 07mins.<br />- No Need for Locker facility. They let you carry small bags.<br /><br />WATER WORLD TIMING (We missed it)<br />- 12:15pm<br />- 03:45pm<br /><br />5th Attraction ""Lost World""<br />- You will get wet in this ride. But only your legs upto Knee. Some drops on your cloths. But you wont get socked. Trust me. I dont think this needs a locker as the sales guys in front of Q advertise. Just get a cover for your bag. Put all your wallet and phones inside it. you can carry the bag with you.<br />- Entry Time: 4:30pm. Got Ride around 05:01pm<br />- Waiting time around 30 to 40 mins.<br /><br />6th Attraction ""Canopy Flyer""<br />- Entry Time 5:23pm got ride by 5:35pm<br />- Waiting time around 12mins<br />- NOTE:- Request for Front viewing seats. Else you will be seated in reverse direction of ride. ;) You are welcome.<br /><br />Amber Rock Climb:- This is the moment when the lady at the service counter said, are you sure you want to do this? We are closing at 6:00pm <br />WHATTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT<br />We still have int tried the main coaster.<br /><br />We rushed towards Battle Star Galactica:-<br />Got the ride around 5:45pm <br />5 mins waiting for Ride.<br />AMAZING RIDE !!!<br />Pricelses !!!<br /><br />To End the day, late entry to Universal studio without express pass during non peak season, turned out to be ok. Q timing was min. If you are with company you wont know the time flying by. We missed couple of rides because of closure around 6:00pm. they had some corporate event taken over during evening. But again if we had come early we still would have to spend more time in Q. its a trade off.<br /><br />Hope this has been informative to you. I will be back to enjoy the rest of the ride soon. ;)<br /><br />oh by the way. food inside are priced $15 to $20 per person. you can just step out with reentry stamp and goto nearby 7/11 and get some awesome food for 3 people for $15 along with a drink. There are enough drinking pods near all rides.","","0","","Written October 30, 2019","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

The good thing about this place however is that the lines weren't too long and it incorporated Shrek, Madagascar and Sesame Street. The Shrek castle ride was by far one of our favorites and a must ride. Super cute 4D theatre type thing.<br /><br />The staff appeared to not enjoy themselves at all. The only staff that was somewhat happy were the ones who did the shows. <br /><br />Overall I would go back again if they added more rides and less paid activities.","Family","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/19/dd/bc/1b/img-20191027-120246-largejpg.jpg","Written October 30, 2019","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

Bought tickets online to save time, only to discover we bought the residents ones by mistake. This was easily fixed at guest services and the cashier even took us through the gate to make sure all was ok. Great service :)<br />We bought express passes and they were absolutely worth their price (cheaper online than at the park). Most we waited was 20min and that was because a ride had been closed briefly. Most were a 5min at most wait.<br />We spent all day there and managed to go on almost every ride that had an express pass lane (midweek visit). <br />Highlights - waterworld show. Just wow. Beware...splash zone is a soak zone. Spent quite a bit of time walking around soaking wet after that! Really amazing show, recommend!!<br />Transformers 4D was outstanding and the single riders line moves as fast as the Express pass line. At the end of the day the lines were shorter so I did this one again as it was so good. <br />Jurassic park whitewater ride was also excellent (got wet again!!).<br />My adventurous teens also loved the BSG twin rollercoasters. <br /><br />There are lots of water refill stations (usually near a bathroom).<br /><br />A fabulous day to end our 2 week holiday in Asia! <br /><br />The only negative was the extremely overpriced food - ours was not even hot (chicken!). <br /><br />Otherwise, amazing!","Family","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/19/d0/b4/25/universal-studios-singapore.jpg","Written October 25, 2019","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

Very convenient so that we didn't have to queue at the attractions which were always crowded. You can buy them also online but I'm not sure if you have reductions. We visited Universal Studios on Monday  and it was a good choice as it rained just when we were about to leave the park at 6pm. Even if expensive we bought the unlimited fast pass inside the park at a shop near the entrance (80 $ not fixed price as changes every day) so we could access all the attractions. Probably the one time fast pass could have been enough for us (cheaper than the unlimited, 50$ on that day). We took a map and day's events list and decided what we didn't want to miss : the Sesame Trick or Treat show (20 minutes) was really appreciated by the 8 years old boy, and the hip-hop street dancers not far away from the first exhibition. Everything was so exciting. The place gets pretty busy during the day so it's better to enter at 10am so that you can enjoy it fully. <br /><br />Recommended items to take with you :<br />- a bottle to refill at the water fountains<br />- hat because the sun can be strong<br />- sunscreen lotion<br />- rain poncho for some attractions<br />- a plastic bag for placing your shoes for water games<br />- umbrella<br />- clothes change just in case<br />- paracetamol (changing from hot to air con places easily turns in headaches.)<br /><br />We had a memorable wonderful family day!<br /><br />","Family","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/19/be/5c/ba/img-20191016-wa0012-largejpg.jpg","Written October 19, 2019","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

Arrive early ( 20mins before gates open). This lets you get a few of the bigger rides out of the way with no ques. Ques were max of 30 mins if you timed it right. No need to buy an express card at this time of the year, even on a Sat. <br />The water world show and ‘lights, camera action’ shows were a highlight. My husband and son also recommend the Transformers . We caught a taxi from Bugis and this cost only about $14. You can get a hand stamp and eat outside for cheaper and go back in. Over all, well worth the money.","","0","","Written October 12, 2019","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

It’s my 4th or 5th visit to USS, and all previous visits are good, but I can’t help but feel that their focus on bringing smiles have gone off track over the years... Hope this review will give make the management team rethink their strategies.<br /><br />My recent visit is horrible, 5 hours and just 1 ride + badly over priced food. Totally spoiled my 5 year anniversary with my wife.<br /><br />Day started at 10am, observed an argument at the gates between USS staff and a group of tourists. It might be the issue with the group of tourists, but the way things were handled by USS staffs is disappointing. Huge crowds of queue resulted from the saga and unhappiness can be observed even on by standers.<br /><br />Since it’s not our first time in USS, we went straight to the biggest ride. Aimed for the Human ride as it says 15mins wait. Ended the wait was 35mins before I first catch a glimpse of the ride. As unlucky as it can be, the ride faced technical problems at this moment. And it took next 20mins of troubleshooting before they announce there is an issue. I pity the people in the queue behind me, as they are in the queue without any information. Since We are right at the front of the queue, we decided to hold on, and luckily the ride resumed after 15mins. I have to say the USS employees did not handle the situation at all, and not the least apologetic. I don’t expect them to bow like the Japanese, but no communication and simply ignoring the crowd wouldn’t make things better. It is almost like the breakdown has nothing to do with them. Ofcourse they didn’t cause it, but they don’t feel the ownership of the USS brand in their work at all.<br /><br />Next, we went for lunch. The steak place we planned to go was closed for private event, after we walk so far to reach it. It’s just our bad luck, but it could have helped if such info was provided on the web or near the entrance. Moving on, we ate SGD13 chicken rice and SGD5 coke each... totally unsatisfying and overpriced... this may be the norm, but I can’t help to be pissed...<br /><br />After lunch, we went straight to the mummy ride, again 15mins wait posted at the entrance. Went in, only see the ride after 40mins. Dejavu.... the ride is down... and waited another 30mins before they announced the breakdown... (see image for photo of tired waiting people) this time, I didn’t wait just left the place. I hate to think that I took a day off from work and paid almost SGD160 just for all these service. Got out and faced another challenge at the locker area, as people crowd around the lockers demanding the locker attendant to unlock. Note: free locker is only first 45mins, any longer you are charged. People are squeezing in and for locking and unlocking stuffs, and it is Chaos!!! 1 old man trying to unlock lockers one by one, other USS staffs passing by just said they can’t help, need to wait for the old man. They sure have the attitude of this isn’t my problem. The same thing happened in my first ride, but at the mummy area is way more chaotic due to small space. Not to mention, we noticed that the entrance USS staffs don’t even know the ride is broken, and they allow more riders to enter to queue.<br /><br />That was it, and we went straight to guest service to demand my money back. It was successful, but not until we have to hear the staff preaching about how the rides breakdown is not within their control and we can go for other rides. I lost my anger a little and told the staff that breakdowns can be under control via proper maintenance (I run a production plant, and equipment management is not new to me).<br /><br />Finally after 5 hours, we got out of USS having just taken 1 ride and ate some lousy and expensive lunch. Fortunately, Vivo City Mall redeemed the day, else our anniversary will end in the worse way possible.  ","Couples","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/19/99/02/00/photo1jpg.jpg

Für die meisten Fahrgeschäfte muss man jegliche Rucksäcke und Taschen einschließen. Kostenlos, nach einer bestimmten Zeit muss man jedoch dafür zahlen.

The picks for me were Revenge of the Mummy and Transformers.  Transformers in particular was unlike any ride I've ever been on and I was surprised how much I enjoyed it.  Just a tip - it's Singapore so it's always hot, but there are parts of the park (primarily Sci-Fi and Egypt areas) that have a lot of concrete and not much in the way of foliage so the heat reflects off the grounds and gets really warm.","","0","","Written October 9, 2019","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

Arriving 9:30 - half hour before park opened we waited in the line for gates to open with some other pushy tourists ( we are from Australia). We made our way around each world trying out the rides as we go. Some lines were no problems 10 minute wait. Others over an hour. Now we could have purchased a fast pass and if it was not going to cost us an extra $350 for all of us we probably would have. Watch other bypass our waiting was frustrating for the kids and some ride operators allowed 1 for 1 but other just let through the fast pass guests. All rides good and there were plenty  for all of us to enjoy. The water world stunt show was very entertaining and we all enjoyed it and if you want to get wet sit front and centre!  A few things that were frustrating where a few of the rides required no bags / hats phones etc.. meaning you had no choice but have 1 person sit off or hire a locker. There was an okay range of food in the park to choose from but as per normal it is a bit more expensive. Plenty of shops to buy merchandise from and at the 6 oclock mark when you are being bearded out of the park the shops are nuts. There is are a heap of food outlets out side the park to have dinner at as well. Overall even though it rained for most of the day it was a great day out!","Family","0","","Written October 8, 2019","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

Take photos with as many characters as you like as its free! It was really great to see a theme park not charging for character photos for once.

Attraction wait times were low and we actually found that most rides, even big name rides like Transformers, only had a 5-10min wait if you were willing to use the app and come back to rides throughout the day. Except thw two rollercoasters where we waited 30min and 45min respectively.<br /><br />That said, this park just doesn't compare to the Florida and California counterparts...we didn't encounter any random park entertainment wheras usually you will find some music or comedy or crowd entertainment in the US parks. Even the two shows we qued for ended up being cancelled due to weather...so a bit dissapointing given that really rain is a common nearly daily occurance in Singapore.<br /><br />The attractions would be good for smaller children as most are short and safe and slow...we found the park a bit short of thrill rides.<br /><br />Know- This is a small theme park with only about 20 or so attractions. We were there for six hours and had circled the park three times.<br /><br />If you're looking for a fun and easy day out in Singpore after having already visited Singapore's other amazing attractions (zoo, gardens, etc..) and you're willing to pay the price tag give it a go...otherwise really its not a must see!","Family","0","","Written October 4, 2019","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

It's such a disappointment. <br />I submitted this review not to discourage people to visit USS but to get my message across the management and clamour for improvements.

Lockers are available next to some rides for no cost for short amount of time. Check out the map before going. Lots of restaurants and food options just outside the park.

Universal Studios, we love theme parks and have been to many and have purchased express passes at those that we could. We have also been to the major attractions in Singapore over the last 6 days. I would never recommend this theme park to anyone. It was unbearable waiting with the express passes, I can only imaging how awful the waiting was for those who didn't have them. Plus an. Hour wait to get through a short line at Friars for food, ridiculous! The express pass is not worth the expense and the park is not worth it without the pass. Limit the express passes further and limit the amount of visitors per day. Either that or provide more rides and entertainment. Quality over quantity. To anyone reading this review- Gardens By the Bay is amazing, The S.E.A Aquarium was absolutely stunning, the 4 park hopper pass- Zoo, night safari, bird park and river safari- worth every cent, spend your money elsewhere!","","0","","Written October 3, 2019","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

We bought standard entry as part of a multi-ticket deal. Having been to Universal in Orlando and LA previously, this does not compare. It’s smaller, MUCH more expensive and pretty poorly organized/run.<br /><br />We followed advice on here to the letter- visited on a Tuesday (mid week) in off season (Aussie Oct school hols). Arrived at 9am and queued early. Went straight to Transformers (no queue), followed by Cylon and Human (no queue), then to the Mummy- so we got all the big ones out the way early. Spent afternoon doing rapids, Dinosaur boat ride and the shows. Only bought kids Shrek pancakes and ice-cream ($15sg each) as food and drinks were SO expensive. Cups with a plastic dinosaur stuck on top were $25sg each!!! We made the most of the day and my boys aged 8 & 9 enjoyed it. Both left with some overpriced merchandise (transformer toys were 3x the cost you can buy them for at Target). <br /><br />We had a good day overall as both boys were old enough to go on everything but young enough to be amused. I’d imagine there’s not really enough there to keep older kids amused for a day and I don’t think we will need to visit again.

Really disappointing for a country like Singapore who has made life of whcr users so friendly with their amenities and pathways.. But they somehow forgot in this aspect. USS should look into this matter and not make us disabled ppl feel so rejected. I spent all my time sitting under the sun while waiting for my son to finish his rides.. And that's what I get for paying $79..? A real rip off or shall I say daylight robbery. USS should find a new way to tackle this matter.. If u all find that this can be misused then pls ask us to produce our special needs cards.. I'm sure most countries have this cards.

The Water World is literally next to Jurrasic Park ride!  And the Mummy Ride is next to the Transformers. And the Shrek Castle attraction should not be missed. <br />We went on a Wednesday and no long queues. Only Jurrasic Park  had the longest wait , about 45 minutes. Other rides, 10mins or less. <br />Everything is expensive inside the park. So, if you are on a budget make sure all your kids are fed and you have plenty of water in your backpacks. <br />Yes, it's small theme park but sure a quality theme park<br />Highly recommended for families. <br />","Family","0","","Written September 27, 2019","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

We were in the queue by half 9 and they started letting people in by about 10 to 10. We headed straight for Cylon and only had to wait 5 minutes then went to Human and had about a 10 minute wait. Cylon is much more of a ‘thrill ride’ than Human. Mummy was then only about a 15 minute wait. Definitely worth getting there early! When we got off Mummy it still said 15 mins so we decided to do it again. However it ended up being much longer and we therefore were charged for having our belongings in the locker for over 45 minutes. It wouldn’t open our locker until we’d paid yet obviously all of our money/cards were inside the locker as you weren’t allowed anything on you! Took ages to find a member of staff and we were charged $4 even though the queue time was wrong..: ridiculous system. The lockers for human/Cylon seemed to be more up to date and the time you were allowed changed based on queue times - much better system.<br />The queues after this were longer, longest wait was about an hour.<br />Do single rider where you can. We did for canopy flyer and Jurassic park and we ended up going very close together so didn’t have to wait around for each other. This meant we queued for about 10-15 minutes for Jurassic park rather than 110. It want obvious that there was a single rider queue so make sure to ask.<br />We kept checking Cylon throughout the day (on the app as well as at the ride - not always completely accurate but better than nothing) and were waiting for it to reduce. At 6.45 it said only 30 mins and we thought we might even be able to do another ride after before the park shut at 8. However it took over an hour. Think they had a problem with the ride and by the time we got there they only had 1 running rather than 2. However in the time we queued, those with express passes got on the ride about 3 times! Seeing as an express pass would’ve cost us $110 each (even buying in advance), it is unfair that they get so much priority.<br />Overall we did 14 rides/shows in the day which we were happy with but I agree with many other comments that express pass holders get too much of a priority.

A must do if you are in Singapore! <br /><br />We easily spent all day here and just managed to get around all the rides and a couple of shows. <br /><br />The park is very well designed, goes in a circle.<br /><br />My suggestion is to get on all the big roller coasters first as the wait time when we were there was 40 minutes compared to 5 minutes when the park first opened. <br /><br />We didn’t experience long lines, the longest was about 30 minutes for a child friendly ride.  Our child was free entry due to age so my suggestion is if you are travelling with young children upgrade the adult tickets to priority so your young isn’t waiting for long for you to come off the big rides, you’ll get on rides a lot quicker.  We were told we just missed the peak season.<br /><br />We went on the rapid ride where the warning was you’ll get wet even soaked our experience yes we got wet but it wasn’t soaked. We didn’t bring rain coats / ponchos and decided to do this at the end of the day. If this is a problem make sure you bring ponchos, you can buy them at the park at a cost of $5<br /><br />Cold drink fountains are located around the park as well as when you line up for rides. So BYO water bottle. Water will cost approx $4. <br /><br />Great family fun day out! Will definitely be back when our little one reaches minimum height for all the rides ","Family","0","","Written September 20, 2019","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

There are a number of other rides for both adults and children. Whereas you'd be hard pushed to do everything you would want in Universal Studios Florida, you could actually do everything here within half a day provided you make use of the fast pass option. Definitely worth doing as a distraction from the more traditional sight seeing excursions and kids and adults alike will love it.","Family","0","","Written September 18, 2019","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

Most of the Singaporeans come there for one or two rides because their pass is valid for one year.  So, if you are a tourist and left one day for the studio, then select the must have rides first and try them.  Select a week day.  The food inside the studio is expensive than outside, but everything is available.","","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/19/4d/bf/91/it-was-fun.jpg","Written September 18, 2019","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

It was definitely a theme park but it missed the most important and interesting part from the US park which is the movie making component.  It has a lot more similarities to Movie World in Australia.<br /><br />We were travelling with three autistic children so I am quite aware of observing how many accessibility options are available at this type of tourist venue.  There was not a specific disability queue for entry or any kind of quiet/sensory maps or information provided.<br /><br />We attended the park outside of peak season and school holidays and found the lines for all the rides ridiculously long.  A lot of the rides we did try seemed dated/old.  The Shrek related 4D movie was interesting but it has a very long build up in an earlier room in which patrons are required to stand for at least 10 minutes.  This is not mentioned in the signage and there were no options provided for disabilities.  It was also poorly organised where people were put i haphazard lines manually then when the doors opened for entry everyone rushed forward, losing all trace of imagined lines we were placed in.<br /><br />All in all I think if you can choose one thing on Sentosa to do, it would not be this.  I think if we ever have the chance again, we will try out the aquarium.","","0","","Written September 16, 2019","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

Our kids 5, 7 and 9 were quite entertained. We have been annual pass holders for several years and here's some tips to share to survive the day with young kids:<br />1) go early. Q starts as early as 9am. It helps to be first few in the Q as you can wait for an hour for some popular rides. Get a spouse to take turns to Q while kids can play at the fringe (water fountain, chocolate store, sometimes fringe game stores, etc etc)<br />2) go straight for transformer with older kids (Q can become 60min later in the day). Followed by the 2 rollar coaster rides and mummy ride (all which can have long waiting time). Go for single rider if the Q starts to form. <br />3) if follow the above it would be around 1045 to 1055. Then standby outside Jurassic world (which opens at 11am). A natural queue will usually normally form but there is no need/point to Q. You just stand behind the rope (as directed by staff). Then go for the dino boat ride and canopy flyer. <br /><br />By now, you would have cleared all the rides that normally you would need to wait for more than 1/2h. Spend the afternoon doing all the shows (e.g. Lights Camera Action, Sesame street, Shrek etc etc ) - weather is very hot in Singapore. Last hour you can go for the dragon ride if you have missed it (not much Q by then) and Madagascar boat ride (no Q by that time).  <br /><br />If kids are not old enough to sit mummy ride and big roller coasters but are tall enough for the dragon and puss in boots rollar coaster then go for that when it opens (both rides also tend to have long waiting time during the day).<br /><br />Food wise. A lot of options but very pricey and unhealthy. Nothing very suitable for young children and they don't allow us to bring in food, even snack bread or grapes for the kids. Yes, I was told to rent a locker outside to put my kids' grapes (of course we refused and ate it up on the spot - it was just a small box). There are many food options outside. However, if you have no particular food restrictions then it is fine. <br /><br />Enjoy! <br />","Family","0","","Written September 14, 2019","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

Definitely worth seeing.<br /><br />Lockers:<br />We recommend renting a property locker at the main entrance, if you turn right immediately after entering the gate, rather than the lockers near attractions within the park. That way you can pay $15 as a once-off expense while accessing and re-locking as often as you like.","Couples","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/19/3b/f0/22/photo7jpg.jpg

The rides were great and so were the staff.  All very polite and friendly, as you would expect in the all the Universal Studio Parks.  Definitely glad I went, and I would probably go again if given the opportunity.  It was very easy to get too.  We used a mixture of taxi's and public transport.  If staying in Marina Bay (like we did), it is a short taxi ride.  Food options and merchandise was great.  Lots of options and the gift stores were fully stocked.  <br /><br />As for peoples complaints in previous reviews.  Yes it is hot and humid, but you probably should have noted this before booking your trip to Singapore.  Coming from Australia, we had a slight advantage as the weather is the same as our summer.  All travellers should check the weather before planning your trips.  If you don't like/cannot stand hot and humid weather, don't book a trip to a place where the seasons are hot and hotter.  Make sure you are prepared for the day out.  Wear loose clothing and a hat when outdoors, comfortable shoes, bring a water bottle, and a fan or umbrella if you want too.  <br /><br />And complaining about queues is a little dim.  Its a theme park that is very popular with a wide range of age groups.  Yes there will be queues.  If you don't want to line up for a roller coaster or to get a photo with your favourite character.  I suggest going in non-peak periods of the year or time of day, or upgrade your tickets to use the fast pass options.  You could also do like my husband and I, and use the single rider lines.  Often they are less than half the wait of the normal line, and the ride will be the same no matter who you sit next to.  <br /><br />All in all, the park was great. It is small, but there are other attractions as Sentosa Island if you still have some time to spare.","","0","","Written September 13, 2019","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

They've crammed a full days worth of entertainment into the small park, though.<br />The highlight for me was the Mummy and the Jurassic Park section.  Water World is also very cool.<br />Staff were friendly.  Many food options, though not a lot of options in each individual restaurant.  On a  friday in September, queues were long, but not more than an hour in most cases.  Single rider line helps.  If you dont see a single rider line, ask staff about it.  Many times I was asked if I was solo and sent up the Express lane with a special 'single rider' ticket.  This saved me loads of time standing in line.<br />Some of the attractions could you use a fresh coat of paint (Jurassic park seemed far too dated already for a park this new).<br />The odd thing was, walking around, this felt like a cheaper park imitating a universal Studios park, not the real deal.  It was still lots of fun, though, and well worth a visit.","Solo","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/19/3b/4a/23/20190913-120846-largejpg.jpg

I aimed for the thrill rides first. Once entered, we straightaway go or ‘run’ to the rides. So, less waiting time there. I was the first to ride the battlestar galactica rides. After the thrill rides, only we went to other rides while enjoying & taking photos. By late afternoon, managed to ride 2nd time battlestar galactica & Transformer ride with waiting time 30mins. Still ok. Didn’t managed to take 2nd time for Revenge of mummy as i felt backpain. The price for food&drinks are pricey, given like any other theme park. So plan & spend wisely if you want especially if you bring kids. No outside food& drinks allowed, they check your bag. So be warned.

We were lucky enough to get picked out of the front of the line by a Universal staff member to be the family that opens the park, they do this everyday. We were taken to a private room in the offices which had signed posters of all the famous artists that had visited and told to wait. They provided our family of 3 with free express ride passes for the day and discounted food and gift vouchers. We then were taken back to the entrance and while a little crowd show was going on before the glares opened introduced us and we then officially open the park for the day. The park itself was great, we had no problems getting on any rides even without the passes although we didn’t bother with the main roller coasters as too scarey for our son. Overall great day and can’t thank universal studios enough as it was our son birthday , also the water world show is amazing do not miss","","0","","Written September 7, 2019","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

I understand it’s hot but as a visitor you want to be welcomed by the staff. Instead most of them barely make eye contact and look really miserable. We are here to have fun! <br />Even though the queues are long thank god you are in shelter so it’s not too bad! 1 hour for the transformer ride was the longest we had to endure but it was worth it. The others? 45 mins for the Shrek ride which lasted 50 seconds??? We did it twice but in the scheme of things it is a long wait for such a short ride. Be prepared. Don’t waste your money on the express queue as you could be waiting a while anyway. All in all we had a good day but we didn’t have to worry about taking children. To any one who takes children you deserve a medal and I mean that in the nicest way ☺️","","0","","Written September 6, 2019","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

He is pretty much a diehard fan of Transformers especially that of Bumblebee. He even went to USS in Bumblebee costume. He rode the Transformers ride for 5 times not minding the  queue at all... We had so much fun that he calls it the best day of his life. <br /><br />It is expected though that it would be a bit expensive treat. So ready your pockets to be deep enough. Save early and diligently. One more tip for guests and travelers, be mindful too of the weather conditions as although Singapore City usually is of fine 27-29 degrees warm, but part of tropical region as it is, even light rain pours could affect some rides and attractions. We had a slightly slow start due to rain showers but had a bit too warm situation when it stopped. <br /><br />Nevertheless, forces of nature are out of anyone’s control...And that overall it really was an excellent day at USS!

Again.<br /><br />全ての日本からのお客様にアドバイスをします。<br />ユニバーサルシンガポールはお金と時間を無駄にする世界で有数の場所です。<br />ここに行くくらいならば、シンガポール動物園、水族館等の方が良いです。<br />ユニバーサルスタジオの雰囲気を味わうのであれば、ユニバーサルスタジオジャパンの方が100倍良いです。","","0","","Written September 2, 2019","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

I recommend coming later as it is baking hot in the day and cooler with smaller crowds in the evening.

A supposed 5 minute wait at the Madagascar crate ride turned out to be closer to 50 (we joked that it was missing the 0). Also, the ""common"" board published a different waiting time then the actual board at the attraction itself (happened to me for Puss in Boots - 5 mins on the common board and 60 on the attraction board. Correct timing is the 60.) The boards are annoying also because they keep changing to useless messages and then you have to wait forever for the waiting time to come back (if you felt confident enough to trust it anyway). It sucks that there is no reliable system where you can look at the waiting time and plan (at one point i was doing this running back and forth because I couldn't find out the correct waiting time for my target ride). I know queuing can't be avoided but at least the correct information should be made available somewhere so that we can at least decide what to do based on the wait time. Luckily the 25 minute wait advertised for Enchanted airways was reasonably close (Maybe I queued 35 mins in reality). <br /><br />It was okay I guess but looks better in pictures than in person. The walk to Waterworld was particularly ugly and uninspiring. Felt like a waste of space with nothing to see. It kind of felt like they got bored and ran out of ideas on how to make it pretty. Or maybe it's a work in progress. <br /><br />The halal option for food was ok: we ate at Marty's food court which I really enjoyed. Portions are large so we shared. Expensive but well. <br /><br />The mummy ride was closed: I wish there was system where we could be notified earlier (but considering that we would already have chosen our travel date much earlier, maybe it couldn't be helped, especially if the maintenance is adhoc? I certainly didn't remember seeing the maintenance notice when I was looking through the website doing research but that was months in advance of my stay). Maybe something at the point of time before we purchase the ticket? Thankfully I'm a bit of a scaredy cat so although I was disappointed I wasn't crushed. <br /><br />I managed to do 6 rides and 3 shows (with too much time wasted queuing for the deceptive boat ride) in about 7 hours. Which reminds me: when I was doing research earlier, I felt like I saw a scheduled closing time of 7pm, but this ended up to be 6pm on the actual day. I know all these are subject to changes but it was still annoying, because you can't expect us to keep checking the calendar every single day. I plan trips way in advance so such last minute changes are annoying. <br /><br />The only reason i managed to get to do more than I thought I could was because of the staff spotting that I was a single rider, so that was nice.","","0","","Written August 30, 2019","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

Great park layout, lots of different themed areas to visit & much to see! Long looong wait times for rides (up to 190 minutes for the popular ones like Battlestar Gallactica & Transformers) so I suggest you arrive right on 10am opening time & do rides ASAP otherwise you'll spend most of the day in lines. Park closed at 6pm which is too early! Plenty of choices for food (expensive, however) & overall we enjoyed ourselves. Could have spent longer there if we weren't ushered out at 6. Regular entry tickets cost SG$80 each, Express Pass for 4 rides was additional SG$120 per person & unlimited Express Pass an additional SG$140 per person, so it could have cost us SG$220 each - totally ridiculous! We just got the regular tickets & managed to get on 4 rides through the day. I'm glad we went but not sure we'd do it again.","","0","","Written August 30, 2019","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

Also, the waiting time for each ride was unbelievably long. The management should come up with a solution to reduce the waiting time.

Le plus gros problème à Singapour c'est le temps d'attente qui est assez long pour la plupart des attractions en plus le personnel me semble beaucoup moins efficace cause États-Unis ou bien que celui de Disneyland à Paris. Par exemple l'attraction de la momie nous avons vu partir des wagonnets vide parce que il n'arrivait pas à les remplir à temps. nous avons passé la journée dans le parc il y a beaucoup moins de monde en fin de journée et c'est plus facile pour faire les attractions. En résumé à faire si vous ne connaissez pas Universal Studio sinon visitez autre chose a Singapour. Visite un samedi nous avons fait les deux Galactica La Momie 2 x Transformers 2 x Waterworld Jurassic Park Twister et Shrek à noter que pour Galactica aucun objet est autorisé même dans les poches donc bien tout laisser dans les casiers contrôle comme dans un aéroport à l'entrée du manège.","Family","0","","Written August 28, 2019","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

As a result we suffered the queues! Apparently the wait for the rapids was 2 hours 40 mins - we queued for over 3hrs 30! We managed 3 rides in a whole day! Not good value for money!

It was a very busy day when we went and all the staff were attentive and helpful. We were pleasantly surprised when a staff member Leng Chew approached us and asked us if we needed any assistance (as we were holding up the map trying to figure out our bearings).

This is the "" benefit' of the $110 express ticket on top of your entry price, which gets you to the front for the first ride, then you queue up with the main queue afterwards. However, the $140 unlimited ride was a real hard one to explain to them, as several children and adults just got off the ride, walked around us and got back on again.<br />Try explaining that to a restless pair of 6 year olds, who are bored to tears, and getting very hot out here in the sun after over an hour waiting.<br />Seriously not a good day, and some testy conversations with overworked staff did not help this situation at all. Cannot recollect this ever happening at any other park where staff have been helpful and eager to assist young children.<br />Sorry,  but we will not be back again.","","0","","Written August 27, 2019","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

Our 7 & 9 year old children enjoyed the rides we did do but we all agreed we'd never go again.  We had experienced other theme parks in Australia (Gold Coast) and loved that but would never go to Universal Studios Singapore again.<br /><br />Our children really wanted to do the two big roller coasters but we didn't manage to do either as we checked wait time on 3 occasions during the day and waiting time was always estimated at 90 minutes.<br /><br />Don't waste your time or money to visit this park","","0","","Written August 26, 2019","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

Bought our entrance ticket with all intentions of purchasing the express pass. I had seen prices of 40-80 dollars for the express pass. When we got in we found the express pass to be another $110 . This on top of the original ticket seemed a bit ridiculous. My daughter went to go on the roller coaster. Outside it said a wait of 80 minutes and after queuing for 20 mins she was then told the wait was a further 120 minutes. She walked out. The express wait was 30 minutes. All the other adult rides had a similar wait time.  We wandered around a decided to leave for a late lunch and return later. At 3pm the roller coasters had a wait time of 180 minutes and express wait of 60 minutes. Other adult rides were 90 mins to 180 mins wait.  The park was very crowded so this would account for the wait times.  Admittedly we are use to the Australian theme parks  which are bigger.  Universal was clean and staff lovely. We arrived just after 10am to what looked live a huge queue but were through the gates in 10 minutes. You can’t take in outside food , water was fine to take in. Plenty of places to sit and rest.  I feel it catered more to younger families. If you are a young adult go with people of a similar age and buy the express pass and still be prepared to wait.","","0","","Written August 26, 2019","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

If you are going, spend the extra and by the Universal Express pass or don't go at all.  Rides that had wait times of 100 minutes for standard tickets we got on in 10<br />2. Buy your tickets and Express pass as early as you can as in when you make your holiday bookings for Singapore.  Don't wait until the day before.  The express pass has dynamic pricing and goes up<br />3.  Give the opening a miss, go half an hour later and you get in quickly and miss nothing as long as you have the express pass<br />4.  Difficult to find much in the way of healthy food - you expect that I suppose at places like this<br />5.  The park is not like Universal Studios Hollywood.  It is not a movie production venue for a start.  I have been to the LA one and Singapore.  Both were good but Singapore is not LA and not the home of Universal Studios.  <br />6. Take some rest stops during the day<br />7.  Yes it is expensive, but you will likely spend 7 hours there.  For us with the express pass it was $170 each.  Works out at $25 per hour.  How many times will you do it in your life?  Enjoy!!!","","0","","Written August 24, 2019","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

I didn’t pre buy my ticket and there were only three booths to buy them so the wait was about 30 minutes. Then you line up to go through gate - another 20 minutes. Just madness. And it was a Monday. I didn’t get the express pass as I was on my own and it made the day VERY expensive but without it the wait was terrible. Even with it I saw quite a wait for those people at some rides. The wait prediction times were out on every ride. One took an hour longer than the sign indicated, which if it had been correct I wouldn’t have bothered. To eat, I exited and went to the food hall at Sentosa. Had a heap of food hawker stalls so it was great. I did look to eat at US and went to one restaurant but was told I couldn’t get a table until 3pm. Strange as nearly all the outside tables were empty. Overall, not the best US experience. I probably would go again if I was in Singapore but I wouldn’t stopover there specifically to go. Which is what I did this trip.","","0","","Written August 19, 2019","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

Already getting to Sentosa with the sentosa express from Vivo city felt like a marketplace with people screaming, pushing and cutting lines. At universal studios it was no better.We were here several years ago and the park itself has not expanded much. Although we really enjoyed it the last time, this trip was rather unpleasant. Every ride had a long waiting period, for the jurassic park line it was !!3!!!! hours for the normal line! Despite our express pass we still had long waiting times ranging from 15min to an hour. Very irritating were passengers cutting lines f.e. at the Mummy ride. Luckily the staff at universal turned everyone who cut the line without the express pass away. However the resulting discussions and arguing resulted in further hold up of the ride... Things have changed a lot in the last few years and the park CANNOT keep up with the increasing number of tourists. If you have the possibility to visit Universal studios somewhere else, do that. We have also been to Japan and Orlando recently and both were so much better. Additionally but expected, prices are exorbitant... Biggest joke is that lockers are charged after 60 min, while waiting times like already mentioned often exceed the 60minutes.","Couples","0","","Written August 19, 2019","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

However one needs to ensure to get here very early in the morning, I would recommend going on a weekday would be way better than weekends. They have rides for all ages from small kids to the older ones. We managed to do most of them. Please ensure to carry your drink bottles with you as it gets pretty hot and keeping yourself hydrated is essential oh and sun screen too to protect your skin from the sun. <br />     The waiting queues are a bit crazy sometimes when it rains they close off most of the rides I don’t really know what the reason may be. The mummy roller coaster ride is a must for grown ups. The Madagascar one for younger kids is a lovely ride. The place has lots of eating places for food/drinks from every section has its own food. Try to make the most of your day out with your family and kids as this place lots to offer it’s a bit pricy though but totally worth it I must say. <br />       You can take a picture pass at the entrance once you enter inside where one can do all the rides and etc and you can keep scanning the code or ticket they issue you with to save your pictures which works out much cheaper than purchasing each picture individually for every ride. Once your done you can ask them and they print them all out for you. I would love to visit this place again one day!!

Here are some tips:<br /><br />1) Get an express pass earlier. Purchase through Klook or any websites. Some attractions took us 120 minutes to queue!!<br /><br />2) If you don’t have an express pass; opt for single rider. Save you lots of time!!<br /><br />3) Bring a water bottle. Refill stations are everywhere even in the middle of a queue to any rides<br /><br />4) Wear light & cooling cloths. Bring extra shirt. I was soaked wet after the Rapid Falls at the Lost World. But totally worth it<br /><br />5) Use a sunblock and don’t forget your shades/caps etc<br /><br />6) When you buy a soft drink or a set meal; you will get a plastic cup with a straw. Use this to refill your soft drinks or slush at any drinks counter at a cheaper rate. No point getting canned drinks at SGD$4.00/can when you can refill for SGD$3.00/drink<br /><br />7) Don’t miss these:<br />- Waterworld Show<br />- Rapid Falls<br />- Puss in Boots Giant Journey<br />- Donkey Comedy Show<br />- there is one where they usher you into a studio and let you experience movie effects of a hurricane in a boat shelter at a New York harbour<br /><br />8) Food is so-so & expensive. Food options here pale in comparison to Universal Studios Japan<br />- lots of food option available outside; get a stamp, go out & eat your meal then come back in<br /><br />9) Morning: try visit Madagascar, Far Far Away land & Lost World<br />Afternoon: it’s hot, spend some time at the Hollywood section, chill, go for lunch & stay hydrated<br />Evening: continue to the rest of the attraction","Family","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/18/d2/e9/a8/photo6jpg.jpg

Были в будний день, но кажется, что здесь собрался не только весь Сингапур, но и вся Азия. Приехали почти за час до открытия (метро+монорельс, от нашего отеля дорога заняла минут 20). Билеты купили быстро, стоимость 75 синг.дол. Есть билеты для прохода без очереди по 1 разу на каждый аттракцион (+50 дол) или безлимитно (198 дол.). Полный развод, там аттракционов всего около десятка. При расчете Mastercard выдают ваучер на 5 дол., который можно использовать в кафе парка. Но в 9-20 очереди на вход выстроились уже примерно по 100 метров. К открытию парка людей были толпы. Мы сразу побежали на «Трансформеров», но отстоять на вход пришлось 50 мин. Перед каждым аттракционом есть табло, показывающее время ожидания. Меньше часа не видела нигде. Плюс в наши планы вмешалась погода - как только на горизонте показывается туча, аттракционы под открытым небом закрываются. А дождь в Сингапуре идёт очень часто. Очереди в крытые аттракционы - более 2-х часов. Подведу итог - за целый день до закрытия мы посетили 3 аттракциона и 3 шоу, это при том, что парк работал на час дольше. В конце дня очереди меньше не стали, нигде меньше часа ожидания табло не показывали. Шоу «Водный мир» шло в этот день только один раз, аттракционы не работали часа 4. То, что успели посетить, нам понравилось, парк очень красочный, но толпы и жара с влажностью убили все впечатления. Территория оказалась очень небольшой, даже при перемещении от одного аттракциона до другого приходится протискиваться через толпы людей.По моему мнению, сюда стоит идти только с детьми сознательного возраста, чем занимали здесь родители маленьких детей  (на входе была масса родителей с колясками), для меня осталось полной загадкой. Взрослым, только если вы не суперфанат американских горок, на которые так и не удалось нам попасть, здесь делать особо нечего. Ну и если вы были в аналогичных парках, этот пункт смело можно пропускать. Возле испанского Порт Авентура этот парк и рядом не стоял, там количество аттракционов и их качество раза в 3 больше! Очень устали, впечатлений особо не получили, на Сентозе ничего больше не увидели. Немного сожалели, что день в Сингапуре провели таким образом. <br /><br />","Family","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/18/c7/cf/97/photo8jpg.jpg

After reading trip advisor I decided to splurge on the express pass which I bought online. Apart from the hefty price I feel as though this wristband made my day worthwhile. I felt a bit guilty walking past the long lines, especially at one point the wait times for some rides (the Jurassic Park one) was 120 min wait time which is absolutely crazy, with the express I had a 45 min wait for this ride. The Mummy Returns rollercoaster was my absolute favourite and the battle star galactica was also impressive. The Transformers 3D adventure was an excellent immersive experience, I found my way in there because my feet needed a rest and safe to say I was blown away by this ride. The food was just food, nothing to get too excited about but did the job of filling my tummy. The street performances were cool, and the underrated attractions such as Steven Spielberg experience were great. Overall it was an excellent day for me as a solo visitor and I’m glad that I went.

You don't loose too much time in lines and they are nice but remember you are in a park.<br />Be prepared to starve because the food is either really bad (worst than average when compared to other parks I've been) and at the end of a very long and slow line. Eat a good breakfast, grab a snack in the restaurants area just before entering the park and go. Inside drink water and fresh juices, eat fruit and return to the restaurants area outside the park at the end fo the day. You will have the company of a lot of people avoiding the extremely long line to take mono rail but you will be able to eat something.

Unfortunately we got an opportunity to visit this modern marvel on a Sunday. A piece of advice, never ever visit this place on a weekend or a public holiday, it just gets insane. The cost of a regular ticket was approximately SGD 79 which included an SGD 5 food coupon. We tried our luck with a rollercoaster called Cyclone which had a 70 mins wait time. We waited in the queue for 50 mins which has no sitting facility and to our disappointment the ride was closed due to technical reasons. We then moved on to the transformers which again had 50 mins wait time. To our luck we experienced the thrill and our wait was worth. USS is divided into several portions like transformers, Egypt land, Jurassic Park, etc and you need to be a good walker to explore this place without getting tired. This place does serve Indian food however I would still recommend to try the Chinese or Malay food when in Singapore. If you wish to buy an souvenirs, they are the most expensive in here. To skip the Sunday crowd you may purchase an Express pass which is quite expensive.","Friends","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/18/b1/f1/97/img-20190728-170817-hdr.jpg

The Waterworld stunt show was fun and, possibly not surprisingly, way more exciting than the movie it’s based on. And yes, you will get wet on the Jurassic rafts.<br />We visited on a reasonably moderate day, not too crowded, but even then the Express Pass turned out to be a good choice.

However, with so few rides, we refused to shell out the 110 SGD they wanted for an Express Pass, as we thought it was a ripoff. The park is very small after all, and it doesn't have a lot of rides. So we chose to queue among the other commoners this time. Boy, what an ""experience"". <br /><br />Here's the thing: When you're in the regular queue, the estimated waiting times aren't working. It varies with the amount of Express Pass holders attending the ride, so if a ride displays a waiting time of just 20 minutes, it might end up being 40-50 minutes anyway, if lots of Express Pass holders go there. When you pay extra for the Express Pass, you're always prioritized over the regular crowd, so when you're in the regular queue, you can do nothing but stand still and with the Express Pass holders walk right onto the ride.<br /><br />Luckily there's not really anything else to do besides queuing, as there aren't a lot of things going on around the park. Unlike most Disney parks, Universal Studios parks seem to lack smaller activities and areas around the park, where you can walk around and enjoy the scenery, or take a break from doing rides. <br /><br />The food is mediocre at best, and don't expect any smiles from the staff either. It's just an assembly line, and they can't wait to get rid of you. Only place we saw staff smiling, was in Starbucks, which is quite ironic.<br /><br />Also, there's the pushing and shoving from all sides, which is common among people from certain countries. And when queuing for a ride, forget about having any personal space. You'll most likely have someone almost rubbing against you from behind, which is not the most pleasant thing, given the very hot and humid climate.<br /><br />The rides are also disappointingly short, especially given the long waiting times.","","0","","Written August 6, 2019","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

If you have no choice but to visit this place, make sure you get an Express Pass (via Klook). It might be worth your time if you have this. We went on a Tuesday (not a public holiday) and the first couple of rides we took had us in the queue for around an hour or so! We had a 5 year old with us and with the temperature in SG, the queue was almost unbearable. We wanted to get an Express Pass after realizing our mistake of not getting one, but apparently, this will cost you an arm and leg if you buy in-house - 130 SGD EACH. We were 3 adults and 1 kid in our group. I couldn't bear swallowing down the cost so we persisted and still tried to line up and make do with our situation hoping that the other queues will be better. It did get better towards late afternoon/early evening before closing so there were shorter queues and our kid did enjoy several rides. We had an unfortunate experience though in one of the rides (Far Far Away: Puss In Boots’ Giant Journey). After we were in the queue for almost an hour and nearing the ride, a staff (local guy) came up to us and asked us how many we were - I answered ""we are 2+2"" while pointing to our group. He responded by raising his voice and saying ""what's 2+2?? I asked you how many you were!"" I was surprised by his tone and asked him what is wrong with him and then he just went off leaving us there – it seemed to me his shift was done. My son asked me what happened and I had to explain calmly that some people are not very smart and are rude. Anyway, this is just absolutely terrible customer service that you think you wouldn't have to deal with at this place. USS needs better queue management and better customer service training for their people. If you like theme parks and live in South East Asia, just go to Japan (Disney, Universal). Do not bother with this place if you can.","Family","0","","Written August 5, 2019","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

When entering we could see how very busy it was and were sort of regretting not getting the express passes, but at $110 each and only being able to use them once per ride an extra $440 was way too much.<br /><br />Now here is my top tip.  When entering the park ignore the first big attraction- Transformers and head to attractions further away such as the rollercoasters. The lines there in the morning were on average 15 mins yet Transformers on entering was 80 mins.  Then when you have been on all the rides at the back of the park, make your way back to those close to the entry in the afternoon.  Yep you’ve guessed it the lines were now at 20 mins.<br /><br />It appears most just head for the first attraction they see.

Apparently they use variable demand driven pricing. When busy it costs a lot more. Despite the cost, we bought them as you come to a place like this to have fun and not stand around in a queue in the heat. <br />Great park and we all loved it.

Like all theme parks, it’s overpriced and their website is honest when they warn visitors to expect to spend an average of four hours of the day waiting in queues.  We went in low peak, weekday, non-school holiday time and still had to wait times of between 45 and 1 hour 40 mins for each ride.  If you can afford it, purchase the unlimited express ticket. Each person will cost $90 (on top of the entry ticket price) if you buy it outside the park otherwise it’ll cost $140 once you’re inside the park. You won’t have to wait so long and you’ll enjoy your day more.

On most of the rides then at least half of the carriages are filled from the express ‘queue’ - which effectively doubles the wait time for the standard queue (and hence the displayed wait time is basically a guess).<br /><br />In parks in the US and Europe they limit the number of express passes issued to avoid this.<br /><br />Everybody expects long queues but is apparent that USS are looking to gouge the customers which kind of took the edge off the day.","Family","0","","Written July 26, 2019","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

The staff seems mostly unhappy to be there and one of the toilets blocks I entered with the girls was so dirty. <br />I'll await for a few years till the kids are older to ever go to a theme park again, as the only way for this day to have made sense would be with an EXPRESS pass (unless you like queuing 4h+ for 4 rides).<br />There's very little entertainment when you walk around, they could have made it so much better for the people waiting. <br />Think about it twice, not the greatest experience we were expecting. The rides for young kids are very disappointing, it might be best for teenagers.<br /><br />The Shrek 4D show was the worst - the young girl introducing the show was so rude and then our chairs didnt work. After 1h wait.<br />The best part of the day was the Elm's TV show - run by great performers, and a great show overall.","Family","0","","Written July 26, 2019","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

We put our things in the free 45 minute locker and waited in line. And waited. 60 minutes later we rode the ride which was awesome. After the ride we had to pay for the locker. After a long discussion with the attendant, we and a few other riders got the locker opened for free. <br />We then did Transformers which was already at a 45 minute wait. We waited just over an hour. Fantastic ride. <br />Jurassic Park river rapids was next which was a huge favourite. And we waited again over an hour despite the time saying a 30 minute wait. <br />Lastly we rode the Mummy and once again despite a 40 minute wait, we waited over 80 minutes. The mummy was my favourite ride of the day. <br />Despite the rides being great, we were very frustrated by the discrepancies in wait times and how long we had to wait.

The reason why I haven't visited is very much because of the costly admission and hearing that waiting in queues is a norm there.<br /><br />Regardless, it was an interesting experience. Did two of the more highly recommended rides amongst others - Transformer and Mummy. Mummy was exciting while Transformer was fascinating in that it piqued in my interest in how it felt like we were moving in the same space but not. Minimal queue (about 20 mins) because it was a closed door event. Would I join the queue again? Not really.<br /><br />Enjoyed the Elmo show as well and really liked the energy levels. I liked the professionalism of the mascots in USS as well. It must have been real warm in there, but the crew gave their best to dance and entertain the visitors.<br /><br />Glad that I finally had a chance to visit after so many years but would not visit again as the place is rather small and we managed to cover pretty much whatever we wanted to in the whole place.","Friends","0","","Written July 22, 2019","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

I would highly recommend getting the after hours tickets on a Friday or Saturday as when we went there were virtually no ride queues for the big more 'adult' attractions, although as the national day rehearsals were going on in the city centre this may have accounted for the lower visitor numbers.  Food was easily available if not a little pricey (but I guess Singapore is a little pricey anyhow) and it is more aimed at families and would be a great day out for young kids.  That being said it was worthwhile for a 3-4 hour visit as some of the rides were great especially the 'Cylon'.","Couples","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/18/6c/f3/07/20190720-205049-largejpg.jpg

We also enjoyed the mummy and the puss in boots ride. Jurassic Park rapids were fun too.

All the worst expectations were unfortunately fulfilled - the overcrowding was ridiculous. <br />The cost to us as a family of 6 was $420, (children over 12 are considered adults, and there are no family tickets) and adding the recommended express passes to this was going to bring the total to $720, just not in the budget given the other activities we were doing over the week.<br />On the credit side, getting there is far easier than the zoo - catch the purple MRT line to HarbourFront, and you can from there walk to Sentosa for free over the boardwalk causeway - the best part of a km but aided by travelators. There is also the cable car (scenic but pricey) and the monorail.<br />Unfortunately, the crowds started immediately - even though we were there at 9:20, the line was already over 50m long. The pre booked tickets through Klook worked well however(scanning a phone barcode) so the line moved fairly quickly. Definitely do not buy tickets at the gate, as this will take much longer.<br />Once inside, got on the mummy ride very quickly, then the waited for 30mins to get on the Jurassic park rapids. After this though it was chaos - the crowds had swelled dramatically and even the lame kiddy rides like the Madagascar boat ride had waits of around 50 mins. Had to wait over 70 mins to get on the (admittedly very good) Battlestar Galactica Cylon roller coaster, while fighting evil thoughts toward the express pass holders who were waltzing past on the left the whole time.<br />After finally doing this ride, the crowds resembled LAX at rush hour, with lines even to buy overpriced food and drink. The kids were exhausted at this point so we left very disappointed. <br />It would seem that express pass holders got onto the rides quite quickly, so if paying $130 pp is within your budget, more power to you. That said, many of the rides were quite meh compared to those at Disney or even Australia’s Gold Coast theme parks. The aforementioned Madagascar ride (an animatronic dark boat ride) has a very tight bar holding the rider in the seat, suggesting a Splash Mountain-esque payoff at the end - but there was absolutely no thrill whatsoever.<br />In summary, do this if you can justify the expense of an express pass, but expect insane crowds (no joy in the heat and humidity) and rides that are for the most part average by world standards. Would NOT recommend without an express pass.","Family","0","","Written July 19, 2019","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

We had two of the rides have technical issues which was a pain - The Transformer ride was really great, and walk in keeps you and the kids entertained waiting, this was broken down when we first tried to get in, then we went to The Mummy ride, which had broken down earlier in the day and broke down again while we where in there, we were considering leaving after 40 minutes but they got things back online.<br />The Humans and Cylones rollercoasters were good, although I did feel a bit unwell after the cyclone ride as it was a hanging rollercoaster and we went upside down a couple of times.<br />Not a heap of food options in there for me, as Im Gluten free but the whole of Singapore was like this, they really didn't have any idea how to cater for Gluten Free.  Drink a lot of water and wear a hat, the heat will get to you very quickly.<br />The bus from Singapore to Sentosa only costs $1 and is free once you are on Sentosa Island.  You can travel to several places once on Sentosa, have a good look around.  When you are in Resort World (Universal Studios, SEA Aquarium etc it isn't easy to fund your way out).

Unmanaged queues.","Over the years, customer service has really changed and it became terrible!<br />Most of the staff we encountered are very rude, and very unfriendly.<br />We bought this, popcorn and it too salty and requested for no-salt popcorn. He said we only offer salty and sweet. And i asked if it can be mixed - he replied with a NO! But it was too salty for kids! Transferd to another cashier and ask for the same thing  and she eventually obliged.<br />Queue for Waterworld is horrible!!! Very dangerous and it can cause stampede!!! Why do they not arrange for a queue line barricades to manage the crowd? So be very careful when visiting!<br />I just came from Disneyland Anaheim, you will see and feel the difference..its not even at par to what standards Disneyland have.

I ended up buying an express pass as some of the queues were up to 2hours long. It was worth the extra money even though it was very expensive. It was very busy in the morning and mid afternoon, but towards later afternoon there were shorter wait times. The shows were great as well.<br />My criticism would be when I arrived just after opening time lots of the rides were still closed, in my first hour I was only able to find 1 ride which was open. This really needs to be sorted out, it’s not fair to expect people to pay the expensive prices and not have rides open on time. Also there was another ride (Canopy Flyer) which had a single rider entry, 3 times I got turned away from this ride saying we’re not doing single rider at the moment come back later. I eventually decided to join the normal queue and was very annoyed to find out that staff started letting single riders through and as a result people got on the ride before me. Overall I had a great day and I hope on my next visit to universal Singapore that these 2 issues have been sorted out.","Solo","0","","Written July 17, 2019","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

Having spent about $80/head for tickets, we thought, although it’s a  fair amount of money, at least it’s unlimited rides. Also it wasn’t a weekend or school holidays, so thoughts were the crowd would be less.<br /><br />Although this was true, we absolutely underestimated how long the queues are, and also the inequality between the ‘have’s’ and the ‘have nots!’. And by that I mean those with ‘Express Lane’ passes and those without. I’m not sure what other theme parks are like, but we (the have nots) lined up with the vast majority for 60min for a rollercoaster, while the Express Lane holders swept through their own queue to each ride, passing the rest of us. They do pay for the privilege, which I worked out to be roughly $210/person including entry, which is an outrageous price. <br /><br />They really should only have a single flat rate of entry, to ensure fairness, even if that is more than the $80 we paid. Ultimately without the rides, the place isn’t really worth visiting, and waiting 60min for the popular ones also makes it not worth visiting! <br /><br />My first suggestion would be don’t go! My second would be that if you must go, get the express pass if you can afford to stump up the money!<br /><br />","Couples","0","","Written July 17, 2019","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

The wait times can be long and single rider isn’t always available - if not paying for fast pass, go to the ‘big’ attractions you want to see as soon as you arrive. I ran straight to the Battlestar duelling coasters and managed to beat the queue (and the ride was great).<br /><br />Families with children would have a much better time here than more grown up kids or adults as there are only few a limited number of ‘adult’ attractions, much smaller than Orlando.","Solo","0","","Written July 16, 2019","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

There are lots of complaints about long lines, but I think if you strategize your visit, you can avoid the worst of the queues. I've been to Universal Studios in Florida, which is far larger and, to be honest, better, but I still had a blast here. We came on a week day and arrived right as the park opened - always the best strategy. The park is so small that you can walk around the whole thing in about 10 minutes, but that just means you can more easily get to the rides you want to visit. <br /><br />Assuming you're not visiting with young kids, I would recommend doing rides like the Mummy and Lost World early in the day. See a show, have lunch (speaking of which, if you book on the Universal website, you can get a ticket with $5 meal voucher for cheaper than the cost of a single ticket), and then go for the less ""thrilling"" rides like the Shrek theatre, Spielberg experience, Puss in Boots ride, etc. Then, once 3-4 p.m. hits, there are pretty much no lines for the Transformers and BattleStar Galactica roller coasters!<br /><br />Food is actually reasonably priced if you want to eat lunch here (and remember that meal voucher deal I mentioned!), and there are also lots of restaurants in the surrounding resort area outside the park where you can eat for probably even cheaper if you get a re-entry sticker. <br /><br />We had an amazing time here - don't pass it up just because you're anxious about the long lines!","Couples","0","","Written July 16, 2019","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

We found Universal obscenely expensive once inside however Singapore in general we found very expensive. I.e a bottle of coke in a cool glass with straw was like $17 each. I’d probably also recommend going around 2-3pm as everyone was there when it opened and it was chaos but when we left at around 2.30pm no one was qeueing at all.

Valid for 1 ride on approx 15 rides (excludes maybe 3 rides where not available). Prepare to get wet feet on the Jurassic Park ride which could make the rest of the day unpleasant, if not prepared! Roller coasters were awesome and enjoyed Waterworld show which we had seen in Hollywood also. Eat before going as food is expensive and it’s hot in there.

Tickets are very pricy considering it’s not a massive park, but we had a great day out. <br /><br />We were there for opening, and literally went on every ride we walked past to beat the queues. However by the time we got half way around we had to succumb to waiting in lines. We waited over an hour for the River Rapids ride which was lots of fun, but that was the last ride I was prepared to wait like that for. Universal studios is very popular so it would likely be like this every day. The skip the queues Pass was expensive and quite frankly, there was still a wait to go on rides. We found the best thing to do was to separate and my husband went on rides as a single rider. You can beat an hour long queue using this trick, getting on the ride within 10 minutes in some cases. <br /><br />Many rides are for younger riders, but that was fine for us. Food wasn’t over the top expensive, but again lots of people means lots of waiting.","Family","0","","Written July 10, 2019","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

Again, all happening after we endured a 30 minute wait to the stunt demonstration which also was cancelled. <br />All in all not an enjoyable day but can’t entirely be blamed on the park. <br />It is a fairly small park especially compared to Paris Disneyland which is the only other park I have been to which is similar ;and is easily covered. Queues however can blow out to an hours wait or more at peak. Priority queue tickets can be purchased for $140/ head. A lot of the rides and events are especially aimed at young children more so than teenagers. Loved the New York street setting as well as the Spielberg lights, camera, action hurricane recreation.<br />Food available on site but very expensive of course.

Average wait time for rides/shows was between 10-30 min. But we waited 80 minutes for the Jurassic Park Rapids Adventure (great ride but not worth the wait!). An hour into the wait, staff announced they were adding more rafts to the ride to lessen wait time. Don’t know why they waited so long to do that! Rather than wait in that line, try to catch the Transformers ride and the Lights, Camera, Action show. Universal closes at 8 p.m., a couple hours earlier than other parks we have been to, so plan your day and skip really long lines to take in as much shows and rides. <br />Some other tips: buy tickets in advance to avoid long lines and quicker entrance (we used Klook and saved some $); bring extra clothes (we got soaked in one ride); bring bottled water (lots of it - it’s humid and drinks are pricey); bring snacks (again food is very pricey, even for a sandwich); bring a portable fan, sold at Chinatown and other tourist shops; and finally, as you leave Universal, stop by Garrett’s popcorn - a delicious snack to end the day!","Family","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/18/36/d8/c6/universal-studios-singapore.jpg

Singapore was definitely smaller but still lots of fun.We had paid for a day entry as part of our travel plans before we left Australia & we had no expectations. <br /> Suggestions - take your own food & drinks to keep expenses down. <br />We didn't know about the - Priority tickets that let you on the rides faster & I didn't find out the price but if you had limited time there it would be worth it. We waited for One hour & 20 mins for one ride and the other rides from 30 mins to 55 mins.  Don't trust the wait time signs at the entry to each ride, 15 min wait sign was actually at 40 min wait. <br /> Suggestion- go on the rides late in the evening after the Street Parade because there was very limited wait times, so we ran from one ride to another. The 10 pm firework are worth the wait but a long waiting for a taxi to get home. We went during the week & I suggest you avoid the weekends.","","0","","Written July 5, 2019","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

Never queue more than 10 minutes. Instead move to a different ride where the express pass gets you in quickly. I am always amazed that people are actually prepared to queue for over an hour for what is a 2 minute ride. <br />4) after doing about 8 rides, call it a day around 2.30pm and catch the Sentosa express over to vivo city  to get a bite to eat that's better and cheaper than the food at Universal.

What a mistake that was! Staff members just not interested and just counting down the hours till they can go home. No atmosphere, no fun vibe. <br /><br />Food was hugely overpriced and not nice. I know what prices to expect, but Disney was a better experience all round.<br /><br />Extra charges everywhere, gone are the days where you can put a 1 pound coin in a locker and then get it back. The lockers are computerised and charge hourly. I wanted to keep my camera safe from getting wet on the water ride, so thought 1 hour would be enough, only to find the queue was one hour alone, so had to increase it to 2 hours. Not cheap.<br /><br />Get wet on a ride? The dryers cost extra, everything is extra. It becomes tiring paying again and again. <br /><br />So why 2 stars? Because there is 1 thing that saved our entire trip.... Waterworld. Finally some atmosphere, laughs, amazing staff members on the show. Sadly the staff in charge of the queue to enter didn't say a single word and just stared at their phones. 0 interest. But once in the show, all the performers were great, and it was a great show.<br /><br />So thumbs up for water world, and a big thumbs down to the rest.","Solo","0","","Written July 3, 2019","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

We were a group of 4 and visited this place on a weekday, having got a lot of advice on not going on weekend as it gets too crowded. <br />We went on a Thursday, reached around 11am. To be honest, the first impression was that it is really small. I have been to Disneyland Paris and Universal was nothing compared to that.<br />The park has 7 themed zones but each has only 2 rides at max. The only zone with more than 4 rides was the Jurassic park. The park has 2 roller coasters in Sci-fi (Humans and Cyclone), 1 in Ancient Egypt and rest are kiddie rides mostly. Transformers in the Sci-fi Zone is a must do.<br />Tickets on the official website priced around INR 4200 per person. But we booked on Klook for INR 3500. Klook has amazing offers for most activities so do check prices here before booking anything. <br />June being school holidays in Singapore it was still pretty crowded but if you visit on a weekday in any other month, it should be a breeze. <br />The Express Pass was a total waste of 40$, as the park has limited rides to justify that cost, over and above the entry ticket cost. A good hack is to try Singles line. The Jurassic Park Rapids Adventure, had a 100 min waiting time, but all 4 of us were in the ride within next 10 mins through the Singles Lane.<br />Also, the food is really overpriced (and not so good either) so make sure to pack some dry snacks for the day","","0","","Written July 3, 2019","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

The ride took 7.5 mins. Another one was a 45min wait for a 35 sec ride. Hot, stinky, crowded queues.<br /><br />Two of the family rides weren't even working when the park opened because of what the staff said were technical problems.<br /><br />The kicker is when you do decide to pay the extra 70SGD pp for an 'Express' ticket to jump the queue, they then use surge pricing and say it will cost 140SGD pp (no discount for kids). Even those with Express tickets had to wait 45mins to ride the Jurassic Park Rapids when the average ticket holder had to wait 2hrs.<br /><br />In the midst of this self-punishment I tried to get a beer. Waited in line for 5 mins to get to the front only to be told the 11SGD beer had sold out. I guess there were other desperate adults who'd got there quicker.<br /><br />As well as that when the kids wanted photos with the characters they were told no, only photos taken by professional photographers.<br /><br />Like I said, if you like to wait in line sweating while having your pockets emptied by Universal then you'll love it.","Family","0","","Written July 1, 2019","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

I really think the operators here need to go to Universal Studios in LA and see how they operate, there is no comparison between the 2. Very long line wait times with lots of people very hot and sweaty and very smelly Body Odour, the park operators need to invest in some air conditioning for the queues. I only saw 2 theme park characters Woody Wood Pecker and the Egyptian warlords. I do not think it’s a worthwhile visit here. The kids had a good time but for adults waiting around for them whilst on rides there needs to be something to keep them happy as well. The fast pass system here is ordinary but the single queue Line was faster go figure.

We tried everything the children were allowed (they were around 120 cm height). We adults like the revenge of the mummy most, while kids preferred the Enchanted airways and puss in boots giant. Some attractions were temporary closed for some hours during lunch time. They said that it's all due to technical problems but ad it's all shutted down around lunch time, I wasn't so sure if it was just for staff lunch break or something. Food is expensive as expected. In general, it was a great fun for all of us. ","Family","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/18/22/79/da/img-20190625-114224-largejpg.jpg

You have to spare 1 full day for the Universal Studios. If you are going during holidays then prefer to take Express Card to save your time from long queues. <br />It was the one of the best places to spend time there and if you visit Singapore then Universal Studio should be your on Travel list. <br /><br />As I like many rides there but my favorite was ""Transformers The Ride 3D"", amazing ride which I have never done in India. I had done this ride twice. Also if you want to go for Rollercoasters then try Battlestar Galactica an amazing ride but go for this ride at last.<br /><br />The Jurassic Park Adventure is also a must show where you will find Stunt Show.which is constructed theater where performers play role.<br /><br />The whole day was worth spending for entire family. And one thing take passport with you so you can go to Casino on entrance of Universal Studio, the entry is at basement. Worth Visit.

Hints : <br />avoid Friday - Monday if you can , that’s when it’s busiest .<br />Be there when gates open at 10 am and go directly to the busiest rides most popular rides , don’t dawdle ( transformers , mummy , Jurassic park for older kids) by 11am the park is extremely busy and starting to peak .<br />Take a water bottle , there are watercoolers in some wait line areas and scattered around park and taps in restrooms , otherwise drinks are expensive .<br />If you are not sure about buying express passes and cost , wait until you get there to buy them , see what the crowds are like , the day we went we didn’t need them but we followed our own tips ! <br />You can get a pass out , try to avoid riding amusements in peak time 11 am - 1630 hrs , do the shows , go to lunch outside the park , or back to hotel if close . By 1700 the lines will have subsided and waiting will be much more reasonable .<br />Make sure you get a show timetable on admission and plan what you are watching and which characters you want to meet and greet .<br />Travel as lightly as you can , don’t take a huge bag it’s just cumbersome to offload fir rides etc.<br />Check out options of riding as a single if lines are long often this can make the process quicker .<br />You may get wet on the Jurassic jungle ride , factor this into your day <br />Enjoy and pace the kids so they don’t get too tired !<br />","Family","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/18/18/8a/e4/photo1jpg.jpg

When entering the park, remember to collect the map and show schedule at the stands next to the turnstile. Spend some time to take photos with the funny characters at the Hollywood Boulevard. If you love the high speed and risky games, let’s start from the right hand with high speed roller coaster at Sci-fi area and Ancient Egypt. If you go with young children, then let’s start from your left hand side. There are a lot of show, performance and photo shooting during the day at the park, but I’d recommend you check the slot and spend some time for the Water world show, in which the actors perform a fighting between heroes and pirates, with lots of action scene. Take notice for the seats, as you may get wet during the show, so have a look and choose the right seat if you don’t want to get wet. Photo shooting with the robots at the Transformer is also a recommendation, you should stand at the right side, to queue in 1st place when they start the shooting.

Arrive early before it opens so you could still take photos of the Universal Studios globe just outside with very few people.

I travelled with my sister and we definitely enjoyed our entire day in USS and we could say that we experienced every bit of it. The highlights that we could recommend are: (in no particular order)<br />-Transformers<br />-Battlestar Galactica<br />-Waterworld<br />-Lights, Camera, Action<br />-Shrek 4D Adventure<br />-Jurassic Park Rides Rapid Adventure<br />-Canopy Flyer<br />-Revenge of the Mummy<br />-Meet and Greet with Minions and Transformers<br /><br />It's best to bring your own ponchos, which you can both use for Waterworld and Jurassic Park Ride as in USS it cost I think SGD5. I bought mine for just a pound here in London, and we used it quite well. <br /><br />There are a lot of food options everywhere.

After all, everyone raves on how ""amazing!"" Universal Singapore is. So the extra 100 bucks on top of the 79 already charged for entry seemed worth it.<br />Well it's actually a bit of hit and miss. You will find inside 4 ok thrill rides. The 2  battle star roller coasters, bumblebee transformers ride and and the Return of the Mummy ride. All the other maybe 5 rides are for kids and not very exciting.<br />The benefits of the unlimited Express  pass is you won't have to wait in long ques (although some rides we still waited 20 min as alot of people get the express pass and are very ""entitled"" about it, and will push and yell at you in broken english how they have express pass). But believe me, you won't want to get unlimited as the rides are not do thrilling you want to go more than once. <br />If you get the regular 70 dollar ticket, expect to wait at least 40 min per ride and up to 2 hours.<br /><br />Lastly I will say alot of tourist who visit Singapore, and yes I know this is cultural, do not wear deodorant.  So the smell is horrendous and takes away any joy you might have from the rides.<br />Even the the people operating the ride can be seen pinching their noses shut as the smell is awful.<br />Save your money, go to dream world and movie world on the Gold Coast Australia instead.<br />","Couples","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/17/f6/c9/6b/cbac3028dbff661cd3d822262e5e2a.jpg","Written June 17, 2019","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

There were waiting times of about 90mins for some of the more popular rides. The park demands that we put everything (not even a credit card is allowed) in a locker. There is a free 45 mins use, thereafter you get charged 2 dollars per 20 minutes. This means that by just taking a popular ride, you will need to wait 1.5hrs and pay an additional 6 dollars. This is ridiculous.<br /><br />The service staff was also atrocious. The ""bouncers"" were talking rudely to any visitors who asked questions. They also rudely tell people to leave the queue after having waited 90mins. This happened to the couple in front of us. The ""service"" was worse than what you would get from a fast food chain. Seriously expected more than USS. Been to every major theme park in Asia and have never seen such thrash service. I think the service level here is an embarrassment to Singapore. <br /><br />Hope some higher up can address the appalling level of service in USS.","Couples","0","","Written June 15, 2019","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

Visited it with my parents who have never seen one before and were up for a surprise. This is the smallest one but still definitely worth the visit. <br /><br />The park is structured in a circle so that you can start in one direction and see the entire park in one lap. The rides and experiences are limited but easier to explore the whole park in less than a day without exhausting yourself. Only a couple of roller coasters (2 outdoors and 1 indoor) but the park has a good mix of thrill rides and family rides and theatre shows / experiences.<br /><br />Check out the schedule before you visit. We unfortunately visited on a day when there was no parade / fireworks. Those events are definitely worth it and would recommend going on a day when they are happening.","","0","","Written June 11, 2019","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

Even the Express Pass lines were over 30+ minutes at times. And without it almost two hours. The lines are not controlled very well either and e.g. the single riders lines were heavily occupied by people trying to get into rides together with family members (and the staff allowed this). Not as organized as in US versions.<br /><br />If you have never been to a similar park and are able to visit outside the holiday season this might be a good idea. But if you expect something similar than in US versions you might be disappointed. Also, do note that at many of the rides are exactly same as they are in US versions (depending on the view this is good or bad thing)","Couples","0","","Written June 11, 2019","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

Our most enjoyed rides: <br />1. Battlestar Galactica: Cylon <br />2. Revenge of the Mummy<br />3. Transformers the ride<br /><br />- Battlestar Galactica: Human was average compared to Cylon. <br />- Lights, Camera, Action was enjoyable.  <br />- Sesame Street spaghetti space chase was really boring for a 12 year old- it’s for much younger children. <br />- Waterworld show was entertaining. The show timings on Monday when we were there was 1 pm, 4:15 pm and 7 pm. It’s worth watching. It’s approx a 30 minutes show.<br />- Canopy flyer was good fun.<br />- Jurassic Park rapids adventure- my son enjoyed this a lot - you will get wet in this ride. You can buy a poncho for $2 before you get on the ride. Even with the poncho on, your shoes are likely to get wet.<br />- Madagascar: A crate adventure was avoidable- again a ride for much younger kids.<br />- Puss In boots giant journey - it’s a good thrilling ride which you can take with the family. Enjoyable.<br /><br />We took the express unlimited pass - it is very expensive but it’s worth the money spent as 1 hour waiting’s are reduced to 5 minutes. This helped us do our favorite rides (all the 3 key roller coasters) thrice each! I strongly recommend buying this pass.<br />Lots of snacking options throughout the park. Also lots of places to fill your water bottle- carry an empty bottle with you. <br />Lunch options are good. For vegetarians, and wanting Indian food, head out to the Oasis of Spice in the Ancient Egypt area. Good food! Also you can get a margarita pizza and a vegetarian pasta in Loui’s pizzeria in New York area. <br />Fantastic fun day with the family!<br /><br />","Family","0","","Written June 10, 2019","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

The best rides were the roller coaster ride in the lost world section , transformer 4d ride cum show in the sci- fi section , 4d movie in the far far away section ,river rafting in the lost world section  rest of the rides were so- so and not worth the waiting time ,but the those mentioned above were awesome and could be done more then once , but apart from ride the set up was magnificent and very imposing , the very idea of creating something so grand deserves great appreciation , since it was school holidays , the closing time was extended to 10:00 pm , which made it possible for us to explore the entire park otherwise it would have been impossible with the wait time , did I mention the fire cracker show in the end which with icing on the cake , for my Indian friend , there is a food joint by the name of Oasis which serves excellent , veg and non veg food which came in very handy. <br />An important observation was that after 5:30 pm the waiting time reduced to 10-15 min and it was during this time that we were able to enjoy majority of the rides .<br />One more tip would be to stay at sentosa island to make most of the attraction at sentosa , <br />We stayed at Amara resorts which was at walking distance from the universal studios and we could enjoy it till the very end .","Family","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/17/dc/2b/43/universal-studios-singapore.jpg","Written June 9, 2019","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

Personally, I think the rides and shows are great, however, they are quite old already, maybe time for a change? <br />Food is not great, but not the worst however price is on the high side.

I know its expensive but it is really worth it if you only visiting this place for a day as it greatly saves your time in the line or else you will end up waiting almost one hour for one game and at the end you will miss other games. This ticket does not cover all rides though like canopy flyer, Battlestar galactic (roller coaster), treasure hunt (waste of your time).<br />2. Food there is expensive however if have no choice then eating there cause you can't exist to come back. So prepare to spent<br />3. Try to go on Friday and Saturday as the opening time is from 10am -10pm so you have more time. Believe me, with express pass I was only manage to complete at 9pm all the rides.<br />4.Get the schedules of shows so that you can manage your time<br /><br />Best ride but scary to max are Cylon an inverted roller coaster and revenge of mummy.

It is divided into zones like Egypt, Shrek world, Sci-fi city etc. Four to five rides in each of the six zones catering to all age groups. It opens at 10 in the morning and it helps be there as the gates open especially on a crowded day like we encountered. We were hoping to get by with just our park tickets but within half hour realized that without Express pass we won't be able to cover even half of it.<br /><br />Express pass is sold in nearly all stores inside the park, we bought ours for a King's ransom at the Hollywood street. The pass price fluctuates as the crowd levels rise and fall, It's probably best to buy it beforehand on their website where we saw it listed the cheapest. Armed with pass we were able to bypass wait times that sometimes extended beyond 90 minutes. <br /><br />Some of the more memorable rides were Puss'n'boots roller coaster, Cyclone and Transformers 3D ride. The live action show called Waterworld was quite a crowd puller, even the large arena was packed to capacity. They cancelled their evening show midway with worsening weather but we returned for the evening one since it had piqued our curiosity. <br /><br />We had our lunch at a self serve pizzeria called Loui's. Most cuisines were covered in the various restaurants located around the park, there was even an Indian food court near the Mummy returns ride. The slushies and drinks were expensive for the initial buy with them selling the park branded sippers but the refills were cheaper later. <br /><br />I'd recommend taking the boardwalk from Vivocity mall down to Universal like we did. It's free and you would enjoy walking over a sea bridge, especially if the weather is pleasant. Universal is practically the first thing you hit once on Sentosa Island. For return you can take the free monorail out from the nearby RWS station.","Friends","0","","Written June 8, 2019","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

When we entered the park at 1040, the crowds were moderate and ride wait times ranged between 5 to 15m. We opted not to use our express pass in the beginning due to short wait times in the normal queue. But post 1130, the crowds started building and the most popular rides, including Battlestar galactica and Transformers had between 45-60m wait times. I would highly recommend buying the express pass as it is a big advantage with max wait times not more than 5-10m. The only “bump” was a rather impatient usher at the Shrek ride and the fact that the ride was converted from a 4D experience to a 3D only due technical issues i presume. However they should have announced this outside so that people would have the choice either to enter or not. The Shrek ride without the 4D experience is just not worth the wait of around 20m ... other than this, i would say that the USS experience is good.","Family","0","","Written June 5, 2019","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

One must say that I entered the Universal Studio at about 1 pm very well knowing the on select weekend the studio is open till 10 am. The universal studios is little small as compared to the one in US but still a great place to visit when in Singapore. There are lot number of rides and shows which one can see and enjoy. I selected afternoon time to beat the heat of Singapore which is pretty much there till 4.30 pm and post that it cools down a bit. The  tourist rush post 4.30 or 5 pm had also settled down and it was easy to access the rides. Ordinarily on a rush days the waiting is approx 45 minutes so one can consider shelling out extra buck for express line. The rides were good. The food inside the Universal Studio has lot more varities and cater to the appetite of all the country. There were lot of rides for the kid with 92 CMS of height which was littte unusual but yes my kid did enjoy it. The parade of the artist on that day was at 7.30 pm which was good and fun. Post, that a live music was being played and it made the environment lively. I believe post 7 pm they serve alcohol too.<br /><br />To sum up fund to be there when in Singapore.

Despite operating in tropical Singapore for so long it has done little to improve visitor’s experiences. It is still too humid in the heat and just lack proper sheltered area or alternative attractions when it rains.<br /><br />USS may have added a few new attractions and expand the park over the years but at the same time seem to have forgotten to upkeep the rest of the older rides and shows. <br /><br />There are so many issues observed in a single visit. If a queue to a ride or show is open, one would expect it to be operating fully but during our visit the Transformer ride has TV monitors at the queue that were faulty and wet floor at the queue area (and it was indoors and not even raining outside). This was not the only ride fault. At the Shrek 4D show, it was worst as none of the effects were in operation (might as well call it Shrek 3D) during the last slot timing. Over at the King Julien’s Go-Round, the ride’s up and down mechanism seems jerky (no wonder they advise safety belts). Even the shows have their share of ‘technical’ difficulties, the Elmo show stopped abruptly midway and the visitors were told to leave the theater. Paint works around the park have peeled from either from wear and tear or just poor maintenance. <br /><br />The staff at the park also seems to lack proper training as announcements are inaudible, they do not manage the queue or able to give clear directions to various attractions. Most seems to lack the motivation to serve and do not exhibit any friendly welcoming vibes. <br /><br />All these issue just sums up to a poorly manage theme park. It is a total waste of time and money to visit the place at its current state. For just abit more money for ticket admission, you would be visiting other larger and better theme parks around the region for a better overall experience.

Yes, an express ticket will eliminate the waiting time. but it is very expensive. While you waiting, you may feel like paying the extra dollars <br />There are only 2 shows for sea world. So plan your visit such a way that you catch one of those shows. I preferred the evening show. The shows like Tranformer , Jurassic park etc. have long waiting time. Make sure to reach the place at 9 AM itself so that you can cover most of the rides. Dont forget to take snaps as photography is allowed in most of the places with an excpetion oif few rides. Drinking water is available on the waiting area and the rest rooms. Take your flask with you. <br />You may have to use the locker for entring shows like Jurassic where you are almost sure to get wet. <br />Free Wifi is available and hence it can be used for communication within your group , even if you dont have Singapore SIM.

We have been to Universal Orlando a few times and found this park to be quite disappointing.  I had read up prior to arrival and it was recommended to buy the express pass.  We bought the single ride entry express pass and with that and our park entry ticket it cost $258.00 for 2 adults.  The park is actually quite small, and took us no time to get around.  We arrived at 10am, and found that at that time the express pass was not even required, most rides had about a 5min wait.  We did use it on the Transformers ride, which had a hour wait by 11am.  There are a few good rides, the Mummy, Transformers, and the 2 main roller coasters, but overall we did not feel it was worth it.  We left the park around 11:40am after giving our express passes away to a young couple.  To be fair, if you had a young family I’m sure it would be more enjoyable, but as 2 adults we were not impressed with the rides, or the park in general. There are a few show, which we did not see, and many retail and eating spots, and you can get a re-entry stamp.

I've never been to India but I'm guessing cutting in line is acceptable there. They send someone to get in line and then when the rest of their group show up the politely shuffle to the front one at a time until there is 8 or 9 in front of you.<br />Or when you are lined up for a ride that is clearly designed for kids under 5 years old and 40 or more adult Indian people with express passes line up and have everyone else's small children waiting in the sun for grandma ,grandpa ,all the uncle's and aunts, mum and dad to have a ride with their one member of their group under 5yrs old.<br />Like I said this is not the parks fault but if you have a short fuse with line jumpers and grown ups riding kids stuff while your kid is roasting in the sun because a 55 year old man rides the merry go round , you will need to know this is going to happen","Family","0","","Written May 26, 2019","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

All the larger rides are to the right after you walk down the main street so if that’s what you’re there for walk anti clockwise and do them first.  We arrived about 9:30am ready for the gates to open and went straight to the larger roller coaster rides.  We had multiple turns on Human, Cylon and Revenge of the Mummy with hardly any wait in the first hour.  After this though the queue time extended out to 90 mins.  It paid to be flexible though as at times we wandered past again the wait time was only 20mins so would line up for another turn. The Water World show was awesome and if you sit near the front be prepared to get wet. Meals start at around SGD 15 for a burger/drink combo and go up in price from there.  The Transformers ride was great fun, my 11 year old does not like roller coasters and he had multiple turns on Transformers. Getting to Sentosa was easy on the MRT and then use the Sentosa Express from Vivo City. You can use your EZ-Link card for the Sentosa Express.","Family","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/17/aa/8b/f9/uss.jpg

Universal is just one part of Sentosa. Its another insanely expensive park, but once you inside you realise that it offers alot. I like the walking through the street theme in certain sections like Sesame street. The ride that sets this park apart is Transformers, whatever you do, do not leave till you experience it. The inter-twining rollercoasters are fast and really nice. Some rides are quite unique. There seemed to be a section still under construction, it looks like a water park. A huge downside of this park is the queues are very misleading. The times on the boards are virtually always wrong. They also have a very devious way of turning the queues into different rooms or chambers hidden from each other, so you cant really see how far away you are from the ride. Having said that we experienced mostly moderate queues with the exception of 1 or 2 rides, time your day of visitng so you don't get bogged down or forced to buy a ridiculously expensive vip pass. We went on a Wednesday and Queues were mostly manageable except for the Jurassic park and Transformers ride.  Stay away from the outrageously priced food and drinks, the indian restaurant in the Egyptian section is the most reasonable priced place. Make use of the numerous water fountains to quench your thirst, I will give them credit for that.

They have the Transformers 4D rides which is a family favourite- so take note the que could get really really longgggg. My favourite indoor ride is The Mummy and it’s Good although it’s in the dark hehe. The cyclone rides were amazing (repeated 3 times) but didn’t get to experience the human rides (long que). Apparently people choose human rides because it’s less thrilling than the cyclone rides so that’s why the lines were shorter 👍 if you wanna get wet (like me), you could get on one of rides in Jurassic World but no worries there’s a drying pod for SGD5 only.<br /><br />We went there on Sunday so the crowd was OK, so some rides has shorter que. Please check the weather before visiting as it could get tooo sunny or u don’t wanna get soaked in the rain. When we went there the weather was like 39 dgrees so we were in our sweats all the time😅 <br /><br />We loved the cafe located in front of the show theatre (forgot the name) coz it’s halal and there’s a cute Elmo burger😬. Other cafes are ok as well but we only tried 2 of them.<br /><br />Most importantly we think that it’s not too big like some other Universal Studios so definitely you could complete the whole round in a day","Friends","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/17/85/4f/6d/universal-studios-singapore.jpg

We did a Wednesday (full day) during school holidays. No express pass and most we waited was 20 minutes for rides. Had printed Klook passes, super easy straight through turnstyle into park. Pick up a daily timetable and map and take a moment to prioritise your must dos by time. Made the most of all the shows and planned day around them, not rides. Water world show was great and stunt actors even stayed after show to have photos taken. Kids will love IT. Each ride has a digital display showing approximate wait time. We used these to find the quickest wait times and came back to the rides that were too busy previously. <br />Donkey live show is a must for all ages, as is Shrek 4D experience and the Transformers 4D ride.  The meet and greets with characters are on time and well organised by park staff, who are happy to use your camera to take photos. No pressure to buy professional photos at any time.<br />If the weather turns bad, all the outdoor rides are stopped, so plan your visit around the weather if possible.<br />Most rides you can take your bags on except for rollercoasters, they have shelves or lockers for your belongings. There are plenty of well sign posted toilets, most offering a free water bottle refill station too. No issues with taking a large water bottle in with you.","Couples","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/17/84/0f/45/far-away-land.jpg

Having previously visited other Universal parks, we were mindful of the fact that this park would be a little more limited in size and have fewer of the large rides. The park is similar in size or scale to Euro Disney with perhaps 3/4 larger rides for the teenagers.<br /><br />We bought our tickets as part of a combined ticket with the Sentosa Cable Car, which was a reasonable deal. A short taxi from the hotel to Mount Faber meant we started the day with a bit of an adventure for the kids. (You can buy the combined ticket at the Mount Faber cable car station.) Having tickets in advance meant queuing for entry to the park itself was not too bad, although signage from the cable car stop on Sentosa to the Universal park could be better. (Once you disembark on Sentosa, you actually need to walk about 100 yards and change onto an additional cable car to take you to the park entrance.)   <br /><br />Getting there early meant that the queue times for the main rides was about 15-20 minutes. It’s worth mentioning that the ride staff are very hot on making sure you don’t take anything on the rides with you e.g. phones and loose change, making sure pockets are empty and going to the extent of using a security wand to check every rider to make sure. If they find anything, they send you back to the lockers. Each large ride has it’s own lockers which are free for an initial period, but cost thereafter. We also rented a larger locker for our backpack, which we had to pay for. <br /><br />Unfortunately on the day we visited the weather was patchy with occasional rainstorms. If there is any threat of thunder/lightning then the larger rides are temporarily stopped. Clearly this is done from a safety perspective to avoid lightening strikes.  However the rides don’t handle this particularly well. We waited approximately 50 minutes for the Battlestar Galactica Cylon ride. Having got to within 5 people of boarding the ride, the ride was suspended due to the incoming thunder storm. No indication is given on how long the delay will be. (Clearly the park has some form of weather monitoring to be able to suspend the ride in advance, so surely some form of indication of the length of the potential suspension is possible, or alternatively, offer a temporary fast pass option to those who have queued.) <br /><br />While the weather was bad we watched the WaterWorld show, which is a water based stunt show. This was very well done. The marking of the seats as to whether you  will get wet or not is worth noting. The wet seats get an absolute soaking both before and during the show.<br /><br />It was a fun day despite the weather. It’s easily possible to do the bulk of the larger rides in half a day, meaning you can visit some of the other attractions on Sentosa.

ALL you need to do is get down at Harbourfront station and then either take the mono-rail train or walk to Sentosa Island. Here are more detailed directions: 1.Take the North East Line going to Harbourfront. Alight at the last stop — Harbourfront Station. 2.Walk into the VivoCity Mall and climb to Level 3 of the Mall, its near in KFC Proceed to Lobby L. You know you’re at Lobby L when you see Food Republic. You might want to have breakfast or lunch before going to Sentosa. :) 3.Fall in line and purchase a ticket. Keep your ticket. Don’t lose it. Board the monorail train. Alight at Waterfront Station. 4.Follow the signs and you’ll find yourself staring at the Universal Studios rotating globe soon after. 5.You can also take the Sentosa Boardwalk to get to the island. It’s a fun experience, too! Best during sunset! --For us we didn't avail the ticket to get inside cause we have only 2days tour in SG if you go inside you have to spend your whole day there cause its a lot of activities inside but if you travel with kids you must add this in your list your kids will love it ,so we prefer not to buy ticket inside since we are only couple .We just enjoying the view from the Rotating global after that we headed to Garden by the bay till the lightshow begin ,we visit the flower dome and cloudforest there also while waiting for the light show from garden by the bay , so in 1 day we visit sentosa island,universal,garden by the bay ,flower dome,cloudforest in just 1 click =Tiring but worth it. That’s it. To return to the city proper, just trace your steps back. :)","Couples","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/17/85/c8/86/great-experience.jpg

We got the time of the shows and were.able.to fix our sched to see everything even marilyn monroe live show. Everything was perfect. The kids had a blast. The only thing is the price of the food, very expensive. The park is also small relative to universal studios japan. But for me i like it since we can go directly to the shows immediately. Definitely.highly recommended. Get your ticket at an online booking site. Very cheap and they also give promo codes. Plan your trip.also around 6:30pm there only few people.left hence we got all the rides for ourselves. Also go to the waterworld where the parade of stars starts. Hence when you finish seeing it go back to attraction or rides that you like im sure you will be the only one there because everyone are watching the parade.

If you are travelling to Singapore with kids, please add Universal studio to your list. Make sure you avoid the weekends. Standing in queue time is much longer than the short ride time. My advice is to buy the fast lane ticket (approx 40 SGD per head) to avoid queue. Instead of trying each ride focus on types of ride. Some rides are truly fast and may not be suitable for younger kids. Be in the studio when it opens if you want to cover everything.

Booked our ticket thru the package offered by Bay Hotel Singapore while my daughter’s ticket was booked via Klook. It was fair weather and enjoyed the place. We were able to take good pictures as it was a sunny day. My daughter enjoyed the attractions of Sesame Street and Shrek. However, queues can be too long and would take you 30mins -1hour to get in each attraction or ride. We didn’t buy the express pass as the price is the same as the ticket price. Food is not allowed inside but you can bring bottled water. Everything is quite expensive from food, merchandise, pictures, etc. But we enjoyed the place as we explored and took photos.

Transport around the island is free as well.<br /><br />Due to bad weather, outside attractions stayed closed for around 2h, really bad, made everything else much busier.<br /><br />But, what really ruins the park, is the express pass. You can pay ~$40 for skipping the line once for every attraction or ~$70 for unlimited.<br /><br />Problem is, sometimes it gets so crowded, the queue is so long, that it is bad for everyone.<br /><br />I was at the queue for a rollercoaster, it was saying 30min waiting, and then people with express pass started to come (there's a different queue for them), and they were coming quicker then the rollercoaster could take, so we started to have 2 queues, one for regular other for express, and the worst, only their queue was moving! There was times were 15minutes would pass and my queue wouldn't move, only theirs!<br /><br />I ended up staying for almost 2h in the line, for a 1:30min ride, totally crap.<br /><br />And even for those who paid express pass, it's not a big deal. Have you magined if everyone has it? You are not skipping anymore, and the park is making much more money..<br /><br />Another good move would be to put signs along the queue path indicating how long is the waiting time from that point. Most of the time, the queue is curvy and you can't see the end of it, so you have no idea of how far you really are.<br /><br />My tip for you: unless you're a teenager with lots of energy to spend standing in a queue, don't go in the morning and don't give them more money for a express pass.<br />Go in the afternoon, around 4pm, it's not that warm anymore, on weekend it closes at 10pm, so you still have 6h left, and all the rides have almost no queues.<br />","Couples","0","","Written May 8, 2019","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

When we pay good money at the gate, we expect all rides to function. They conveniently stopped the Jurassic World Rapids Ride and almost stopped Revenge of the Mummy ride but I think the anger of the crowds made them restart the spectacularly scary Ancient Egyptian treat.<br /><br />Some tips:<br /><br />1. The food there is expensive and of very high quality. Indian Food being the best. A family of 4 can order 1 Mutton Biriyani, they will add lots of veggies with it, so add 4-5 parathas with that and share.<br />2. They did not check us for water bottles, so try your luck.<br />3. We went on a Sunday, so wait times were like 70-80 minutes for main rides. I bought the express ticket. Worth the extra money as our wait times were 2 minutes and we could enjoy hours of the Hollywood Ambience after we completed our rides.<br />4. You have to bring your passport if you want to do rock climbing. Total hassle, avoid.<br />5. Water World Show is at 12:30 and 4 PM, so plan accordingly. Best to go there early with ticket booked online.<br /><br />","","0","","Written May 7, 2019","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

Be aware of the weather! ","We visited on a Saturday with a normal pass but after going to get on the first ride we decided to purchase the Express pass. We went to our first ride and it was amazing to skip 60mins queue. <br />However, going to our second ride they didn’t let us get on, there were some thunders and they were afraid a thunderstorm was coming and didn’t know when the rides would be back on again. We decided to ask for a refund for the very expensive ($120) express pass we just paid but apparently they don’t offer a refund in any case. We were really annoyed as we just purchased that few minutes ago and the people who sold it to us should have mentioned the weather. Also while we were waiting to request the refund the employee sold the same tickets to a family and didn’t say a word. <br />We took the matter to the customer service and after a long conversation they were sincerely apologetic and said that the employees should have told us in advance. They offered us coupons and stickers to our little one and we tried to get the most out of it, and visit all the indoors ride and shows.<br />The storm passed 1.5hr later and we managed to get on in most of the rides!!!<br />The express pass is really expensive but it’s worth the time you spend waiting at the queue. <br />We had a great day! The rides are amazing and the shows too. ","Family","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/17/6d/3f/7e/photo2jpg.jpg

We purchased standard tickets and hoped that being a Monday it wouldn't be too busy. We were wrong! From around lunch time even the kids rides had a wait of close to an hour. Like may other people have said, it's extremely hot in Singapore so waiting around in the heat for close to an hour for a ride that only goes for a minute or 2 is ridiculous, especially with kids. <br />The park is small in size, so it doesn't take long to get around. Attendants at the rides had no personality and moved so slow getting people on and off rides. If it was managed better I'm sure the wait times would have been halved. Most of them seemed to be so unhappy with their jobs, no smiles or happy faces.<br />We would have been able to get on more rides with the fast track tickets, however the cost on this day was the same price as a ticket $70SGD pp which was more than we wanted tp spend, so we just raced around as soon as we got into the park to get as much doon as fast as we could.<br />We watched the Sesame Street show, I would recommend for 0-5 years, WaterWorld Show was good, but very very very hot sitting around. We also watched Shrek 4D which was good even though our chair broke 1/2 way through!<br />We left the park at lunch time and got a pass out as there were many well priced restaurants (including McDonalds) a whort walk away. <br />Overall I was disappointed with USS, I'm not sure if I would recommend this theme park to family and friends. I'm glad we can tick it off our list, but I wouldn't go back.","Family","0","","Written May 7, 2019","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

Before bringing my Son I thought to visit first and inquire and experience enough to make my son's visit very comfortable and productive. Since I don't watch much of the kids serials so I had not much idea for this whole concept. A complete day was spent over there. Since we visited on Saturday so we had option to stay until 10 PM night. The first thing is there are some online options available to buy tickets so explore that and you may get 10% discount. If you want to cover all rides. Either you start as early as 10 AM in the morning or else you buy express pass. For 1-2 minutes ride you may have to wait for an hour or so. The Roller Coaster was amazing. I had tried the Cyclone one. There is another roller coaster related to transformer. That can also be experienced. We watched some animated movies which was amazing and those were must watch. It is good to visit this place the day when it is not very hot as you have to walk in open area. You  should spend time in the evening also to see the effect of lights. Some of my conclusions about Singapore Universal studios are as below.<br /><br />1. The Size of this Studio is relatively smaller than US.<br />2. Number of rides are less.<br />3. The tickets are relatively cheaper.<br />4. The age of the kid should be more than 6 to enjoy this place.<br />5. If you are having great flair for Roller Coaster then you should visit this place. If not you can avoid this place.<br /><br />Overall a nice Place. If you have sufficient time while in Singapore. This should be one of the top 10 item to visit.","Business","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/17/6d/18/b7/water-ride-inside-jurassic.jpg

We are very exited to see the place and probably have been planning for 3 months to visit this place. While there is no complaint on actual rides or the shows... i felt the owners are in the business of money minting rather than providing entertainment  :(  Let me share my experience:<br /><br />we reached the universal studios at 9:30AM, the gates open at 10AM, each line has already a que of 30 - 40 people standing and waiting. <br /><br />@10AM they opened the doors, we first entered madagaskar, first two of my rides are done with 10 mins waiting. <br />@11AM we entered the jurassic park, for the boat ride we entered the queue, it took 1 hour 10 mins for us to get in to a ride of 3 minutes , <br />By this we already tired of standing a long queue and its 12:30 by the time we finish this. <br />Later we went to Egyptian theme (Revenge of the mummy), the board said it has a wait time of 120 Mins :( At this time we checked few other places, every where the minimum standing time in queue is more than 80 Minutes :( Horrible <br /><br />Later we went to lights camera action, we stand in queue for 15 mins, while the show is good... <br /><br />The major problem for the entire US is long wait times.even after one spending $75 you have to wait for 1 - 2 hours for your favorite ride, in reality you won't be covering more than 4 - 5 rides on a peak day and is total waste of money and time. <br /><br />Just to add pain to the wound, they have an express line which they charge another $70 or so where you get direct access to the rides.. ( nice way to mint more money .. by making every one stand for hours and than collect extra amounts for faster access)<br /><br />By the way, i rate very high about quality of shows and rides (you enjoy them)<br /><br />Overall, Before my trip, i was super exited about this, but after visiting this actually i felt it is a total money minting machine.","Family","0","","Written May 6, 2019","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

We were advised by our travel agent to ensure that we take the Express pass and we were delighted to have done so !! It actually saved us a lot of time and we didnt have to go through the agony of waiting in long never ending Qs forever !!! We had gone to Universal around New year and the crowds were over whelming. Without the Express pass we would not have been able to cover all the rides and some even multiple times. My personal favorite were the Transformers,  Steven Spielberg show, Gallactica roller coaster and the Jurrasic park theme rides. We also experienced the fireworks at 11 pm and the parade in the evening. Overall its was one of the most expensive day for us but worth every Dollar spent.

We arrived right on 10 and our strategy was to visit the park anti clockwise. We didn't have to queue very much for any ride (max 20 mins). My tip is that if you have very young children go clockwise, if you don't go anti clockwise. We didn't eat in Universal- right outside is the Malaysian Street food hall where you can get really tasty, cheap (under $10) meals.","","0","","Written May 3, 2019","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

Good for a day out but falls short of the US locations. It is of course much smaller and the rides seemed 'tamer' than the US versions. <br />The more mature staff are polite and helpful but the younger (entitled) generation seem to have the opinion the park is there to provide them with a job,not for them to provide great customer service. Take note Universal, your younger staff need a lot more lessons in customer service. <br />The park is on Sentosa Island and getting here is relatively simple using the cable car, light rail,bus, car or taxi. Being smaller there are fewer attractions and rides but you will still need the better part of a day to get round everything. Singapore is a very popular tourist destination so worth the extra charge for the ""Fast Pass"" or Universal Express as they are called here. <br />There are the usual gift shops and many food and beverage options to chose from within the park. Not brilliant but a fun day out.","Couples","0","","Written May 1, 2019","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

This saved us hours of queuing time and allowed us to visit all the attractions. <br /><br />The highlight of the park is the HUMAN Vs CYLON. <br /><br />CYLON is the most thrilling of the rides and along with my son, we had the most fun in this ride. Make sure that you wait for an extra turn to take the front row seats as this provides the maximum thrill especially when it accelerates fast and dives down. This ride involves sudden acceleration, fast dives and 5 times in the ride it goes upside down. Make sure that the stomach is empty before this ride<br /><br />HUMAN on the other hand is a bit subdued with no 360 degree rotation. It is much doable for those afraid of the roller coaster rides.<br /><br />The other rides worth doing (In the order of preference)<br />- Transformers the ride<br />- Mummy<br />- Lost world Rapids adventure (You will be soaked)<br />- Shrek 3D <br />- Puss in the Boots<br />- Lights camera Action<br /><br />The only show that is worth seeing (Must do) is the water world show next to the Jurassic world. Show timing is at 4:30pm. Make sure to arrive at 4:10pm to get the best seats.<br /><br />Overall a fun filled day and based on the crowds, it is worth buying the express pass. Food is expensive inside and Louis pizza is recommended. There are many places to fill water bottles and lockers near the Mummy ride are free for 45 minutes.","Family","0","","Written May 1, 2019","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

Di tiap pintu masuk wahana ada informasi antrian berapa menit, cermati apabila ingin masuk, jangan lupa ambil peta di pintu masuk, untuk mempermudah mobiltas kita di dalam taman. Sempatkan untuk menonton atraksi Waterworld, karena menurut saya ini adalah atraksi terbaik di sini, atraksi favorit lainnya menurut saya adalah Transformers, Jurasic Park (siap-siap untuk basah), Battlestar Galactica Human vs Cylone dan juga Istana Far Fara Away. Selamat berlibur.","Couples","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/17/57/d7/95/uss.jpg

Especially having the experience in other theme parks outside of Singapore. It was a demoralising start. The signage showed wait-time at Galactica ride to be 70 minutes, but we were caught in the queue for 120 minutes before we could take our ride. Even simple rides like Treasure hunt has queue time of 30 minutes displayed. Our experience suggested to us that we should not trust the signage as we waited longer than what was stated. We spent more time in the queue than enjoying ourselves on the rides. Just because we did not buy ""express"" tickets, cannot be used as an excuse to make us wait longer than what was projected. <br /><br />The services are closed to non-existent. The service staff lacked charisma and ushered us as if we are on a bus-ride.   <br /><br />I will definitely not bring my guests to visit Universal Studios Sentosa if there is no compelling reason to do so.

Since we had limited time and also 2 kids along with us, we decided to book the VIP experience. Even though it was way beyond our budget, it was one of the best decisions we made. <br /><br />VIP experience is a 5 hours guided tour of USS covering almost all the rides and zones along with a guide and the best part is we get priority entry everywhere. We are literally treated as VIPs. <br /><br />As per the instructions shared during our booking, we reach USS 15-20 mins before the tour started. In our case the tour was scheduled to start at 10:00 AM. We were introduced to our guide Jethro and he was an amazing person. He explained to us the various zones in the park, asked our preferences and planned the entire tour in such a way that we have the best experience without missing any of the rides or shows. <br /><br />As mentioned earlier, we got priority entry to almost all the rides and shows, watched the Waterworld stunt show from an exclusive airconditioned viewing room, front row seats to all rides and shows, food coupons, special tags, badges, etc. <br /><br />Jethro made our trip to the USS absolutely amazing and we enjoyed the entire experience without getting tired or losing time waiting in queues. Thank you so much Jethro. You are a rockstar!!!!!<br /><br />The VIP experience is definitely a must do and you will never regret the extra money shelled out. <br />","Family","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/17/55/8f/89/photo7jpg.jpg

Invested in 2 x Universal Express passes ($S90 each).  These proved invaluable and ensured that we waited no more than 20 minutes in a queue for the rides so I recommend the investment if you are wanting to spend the day on the rides.  Huge down pour an hour before the gates opened which must never deterred people from coming as the place didn't seem too busy or crowded.  There are free lockers for between 45 or 105 minutes (free period depends on the length of the queues at the relevant rides) otherwise it is up to $S20 for the day.  Lucky enough to go on about 30 rides as the express pass lines were not more than 20 minutes, most rides we were able to get on straight away.  Plenty of food options available however most were closed due to the smaller crowds and I assume the weather but still plenty of choice.  Otherwise, get a pass out and go the the food options outside the park.  Fireworks were ok without being spectacular but worth waiting for and a good way to close out the day.  The weather improved throughout the day so my 13 year old son and I have a great time. Would return again and would also purchase the express passes as they save so much time in queues, even if they cost more than the entrance fee!!.","Family","0","","Written April 29, 2019","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

If you dont like roller-coasters, then the Universal Studios might be a bit boring. There are many different themes (from Egypt to Jurassic Park), but in the center of all themes are roller-coasters and souvenir shops. That gets a bit boring, especially if you dont really like roller-coasters. In summer time when there are long queues, it might be disappointing to queue for 1+ hour for a 5-10 minute ride, only to queue at the next attraction. So overall, its nice to have been there, but no „must“ in Singapore.","Couples","0","","Written April 28, 2019","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

We didn’t need the express pass as it was raining so less people but I’d suggest on a busy day this would be well worth it. It’s also over a small space which is great as not too much walking for the little ones.<br />They also keep the park open late on Friday and sat and it was literally empty - no queues above 5 mins for anything so strongly suggest you stay til the evening if you can.

","Husband and I visited on the 24th December. Holiday time so As expected it was pretty bus, queue times were long especially on the rollercoasters and popular rides such as the River Rapids and Transformers. I suggest getting to the park early and RUNNING to your first ride and youll save yourself an hour. If you want to skip the queues but don't want to pay for fast track tickets, head there AFTER 4-5pm; we actually got on more rides after this time then we did the whole day before - literally the rollercoaster queue times were under 30 minutes by the evening time, as opposed to 120-180 min. If you have bags put them in an all day locker at the lockers next to River Rapids ride in Jurassic area; don't fall for the timed lockers next to the rollercoasters because you'll likely overrun your tine and pay extra - seriously just get an all day locker or take nothing with you. Oh and another tip, bring a water bottle with you, even when queuing for rides, alot of the long queues can be agonising in Singapore heat and the A/Cs aren't great - i saw many people just putting their bottles or glasses on the other side of the ride platforms but DO NOT take your full bag in the queues or you'll be sent away disappointed.

As it wasn’t school holidays, I probably needn’t have if I’d really wanted to save the cost, as the longest queue I saw whilst there was about 15 minutes. <br />I really enjoyed The Mummy coaster, as it’s air conditioned and a fun ride to do over and over and over when it’s hot. <br />I also really enjoyed Humans and Cylons, which are certainly thrilling if not a little shorter than expected. <br />The very best aspect of this delightful park, which has fun rides for all ages, is its size. You will not find yourself exhausted trekking from zone to zone or ride to ride. Highly recommended.","Solo","0","","Written April 24, 2019","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

We got there early and managed to get on almost every ride, many more than once.<br /><br />Most of the rides have been around for a few years so it was a bit of a repeat from our trip 4 years ago, but the Rollercoasters were new and a lot of fun.<br /><br />We went with two adults and two kids (15 and 12).  The best rides were, in order, the Ceylon Rollercoaster, transformers ride, hi an rollercoaster and the Mummy Rollercoaster.<br /><br />Pretty good range of food.  Prices are OK - what you would expect at any theme park.<br /><br />My tip is to avoid long lines for the biggest rides by waiting until around 4pm.  You will wait around 10-15 minutes and be able to have multiple rides in a short period.  Just monitor the times from around 3pm.","Family","0","","Written April 24, 2019","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

We didn't BUT we got there nice and early and were prepared. We got to Vivo City at 8:40am and waited until 9am for the Sentosa counters to open.  We bought our tickets there so when we got over we could go straight in.  We got there first thing and waited by the gates.  We were first in line when it opened at 10am. They do a little intro and they had a thing where the most enthusiastic patron won express passes. My son was lucky enough to win,  so he got 5 fast passes for any ride for the day.  1 time use.<br />So when we got in we ran straight to the Transformers ride and got straight on. <br />We then managed to go on most rides and got you the Waterworld Show for 12:30.<br />A must see show!<br />Then we had lunch at Mels Diner where they had awesome Elmo Burgers, that actually tasted amazing,  and Cookie Monster shakes!<br />Then we had the longest wait for any ride,  1hr 30mins for the Human roller coaster.  We had gone to go earlier but it was closed for technical issues.  So we lined up but right as we got to the top they closed it again.  We took the gamble to wait and we waited a further 20mins at the top to get on.  A little annoying was once the ride was up and going again they had reopened the line downstairs so all these fast pass people got straight on and the people who had loyally waited out the technical issues waited even longer. But overall, it was a great day!<br />We went on a Thursday , as apparently weekdays are quieter. Friday, Saturday nights it's open later but you run the risk of it being busier.<br />Don't think about it,  just go!!","Family","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/17/43/94/f8/20190418-140113-largejpg.jpg

Perhaps, it would have been more enjoyable if we would have purchased a fastrack pass, but that makes the day very expensive for a family of 4, and given the short duration of the rides and experiences, i don't think that expense would be justified.","Family","0","","Written April 21, 2019","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

An express pass will set you back US$40 per person and you can only use it once per ride.

There’s no Harry Potter or adult themed rides beyond The Mummy (which is great).  It is clean and well maintianed though.<br /><br />The overall atmosphere is not one of joy or adventure - just random disorganised chaos. I think they could benefit from more staff on the ride entry areas and marshalling people generally. It’s common in Asia for there to very large organised groups moving around together and this is not helpful in a theme park setting.<br /><br />It’s got some unique rides (the Jurrasic Park raft elevator and drop concept is cool) but the overall issue here is severe lack of crowd control and the whole queue management issue.<br /><br />Be patient. Drinks lots of water and be prepared to wait. Even with a express pass.<br /><br />Speaking of which - the express pass needs to be printed out so the ride staff can literally tick off (with an actual pen) which rides you’ve been on. It’s 2019. But go figure.<br /><br />The staff are permanently having to repeat ‘use the lockers’ and ‘no bags’ to EVERY rider. There are no clear signs. The locker areas are small and chaotic. Be prepared to leave you stuff, no matter how small - so do all these rides in one maybe?<br /><br />The big rides (BattleStar) only seem to have one set of cars running, so theres no way to speed up loading.<br /><br />The number of rides breaking down or on hold was pretty high too.<br /><br />So, yeah give it a go but have realistic expectations!<br /><br />","Friends","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/17/35/d1/e0/photo0jpg.jpg","Written April 19, 2019","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

We also get to sit and rest in the air_con emporium food court at new york, hiding from the heat several times without being thrown out.<br /><br />Food: we had our lunch at the Mel's, a very expensive meal, $16 for a Elmo burger with fries and $16 a bacon beef burger with fries, $12 for a drink, in total spent $44 for just a simple meal. It was a hot day, with not much appetite, the 2 sets was enough for 2 adults and a child to share. Probably the staff would like to remind guests that the eyes and the nose on elmo is just printed paper and not edible. Our child took a bite on it, happily thinking it was chocolate.<br /><br />Retail: The selection of souvenirs and toys are wide, prices are quite reasonable for some, especially the toys. <br /><br />Restrooms and water coolers are quite accessible, despite the hot weather, we get to keep ourselves hydrated conveniently.<br /><br />Overall, we had fun, and we were very glad that we had went for the transformer ride before our child freaked out. USS is probably not suitable for young children, more for the fun-loving teens.<br /><br />By the way, we find that the quality of the 3d glasses at the transformers are very much better than the ones at shrek 4d, shrek ones are much more blurry.","Family","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/17/32/ba/f0/universal-studios-singapore.jpg","Written April 18, 2019","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

A good range of rides and activities and compared to some parks a variety of food options although few healthy ones. I would recommend you get to the park before choosing the fast pass option as queues were fairly short on the day we visited and would only have done 1 time only pass rather than multiple. Staff were enthusiastic and helpful even with some difficult audiences.

","For those with kids it's a great place to explore but one day may not be enough for all the play and theatre show plus adult rides.<br /><br />For adults, all you need are scifi double roller coaster rides (u can literally repeat these two rides from human to cylon whole day long is good enough haha!).<br /><br />Dont miss out on mummy indoor roller coaster ride (great ride must try! Can be scary even for kids age 9 and above due to the cinematic effects). <br /><br />Jurassic world: the sky ride and rock climbing (over and over) but the water boat ride will just be for once experience will do. Just skip the long queue and head on to single person ride. It's quicker.<br /><br />The puss in boot sky ride and the castle dragon roller coaster in the far far away castle are fun.

","If you have been to Universal Studios, LA, USA or Disneyland, USA & France, then this place wont fascinate you much. For decades everything is same nothing new, so don’t repeat it. <br />Its a small Universal Studios and good for those who haven’t been to such place ever before. They have limited rides and some of the roller coasters don’t work, they give an excuse of technical problem. Buy express pass if you want to avoid standing in que for hours, no seating arrangement in que so sit on floor or stand and after waiting for hours the attaraction/ ride is hardly for 1-2 minutes. The food options are poor and disappointing when you pay so much, neither tasty nor enough food options. Just average attaraction to visit. Also, restaurant staff needs to be taught hospitality.

It is so stupefying and here are some reasons why. The first reason is that the food tastes amazing and it’s affordable. The second reason is the rides are really enjoyable that I think you should try it. For example, the Trasformers ride. You get to ride a car and the whole ride is 3D! Third reason is, they have lot’s of shows and most of them are for kids. I hope this is a good place for you now and I highly recommend it for kids but it may be better if you go as a family.","","0","","Written April 12, 2019","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

I had told my kids to plan their USS trip and first thing they decided was to keep a whole day for USS. It's better if you visit on weekdays as it will save long ques. First do all the outdoor rides and the thrill rides and later go for indoor rides. Try to reach at 9 AM as there is a long queue to enter. Carry some snacks and water but preferably ride light. We all enjoyed Battlestar  Galactica:Cylon, Transformer, Revenge of the  Mummy, Jurassic Park. There are some shows going on. We liked Donkey show a lot. Steven Spielberg show was fascinating.

So the express pass is well worth with the time you'll save. Great rides for everyone. Themes are well executed. Water show was crazy, a must see.

Cheaper to buy online I guess, but you can still get one in vivo city 3rd floor, or at the universal studios entrance. Try to visit some travel advisors located all around the city, they might give good advice: for example, they gave me the brochure with which we could save 10% from Studio's ticket. <br />We were one of the first to arrive at the studio's entrance. A line gathered about 15 minutes prior to opening.Host at the entrance also gave one RED TICKET (I think it offers you to pass all lines and/or limitless rides) for the person who was the loudest. I didn't need it since I was with my husband and thought it was pointless to enjoy all the rides all alone. BUT you can make sure if it will help your partner or a child to pass along with you. <br />Anyways,<br /><br />this was our first visit to a park of this size and this fun. I've read many reviews saying that after Orlando this one looked lame. I've never been to Orlando, and we LOVED Universal Studios Singapore. Especially we loved the show Water World, LightsCameraAction! I even talked with Interactive Donkey from Shrek. That show probably mostly for children, but still fun. I didn't like much Jurassic period, because the boat was spinning all the time. and yes, you will get wet. <br /><br />All in all, we loved our day, we were there until 16:00, but we loved all about it.","Couples","0","","Written April 5, 2019","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

I craved for a variety of rides that were full of originality and creativity.<br /><br />Personally, I believe the scorching temperature and humid weather may have influenced my feedback.

This is where a taxi or Singapore’s version of Uber called Grab (an excellent service)will drop you off.<br />When we arrived the queues to get in were massive luckily we had purchased tickets online so that was one less queue to be in . <br />Very quickly we figured out that people will queue if there is a queue . The secret is to walk the path less trodden . At the main gates there are multiple entry points people just seem to gravitate to the centre walk to the sides and you can walk straight in. <br />There is a fast pass available and we were there on a very busy day but the secret to not needing one is to not go to the first ride  walk on to the third or fourth and you will be straight on the ride. Stay ahead of the crowds and you can ride all day no fast pass required. Every ride we went to had an indicated wait time of 5mins whilst some we walked past were and hour! <br />Don’t miss the waterworkd show it’s awesome. <br />Jurasic park ride you will get very wet and you can by a single use poncho if you don’t want to get wet they are about $5 each and very flimsy so I doubt you could wear it more than once. Save your money get wet cool down ,it’s always hot and feel good that you didn’t contribute another massive piece of plastic to the oceans of the world.<br />Food is your normal theme park fare with some interesting Asian style twists $$$.<br />Getting home we jumped on the monorail and back into the city on the MRT so easy just make sure you have an MRT card . We loaded ours with $10 and still had credit at the end of the week.<br />The take home tips .<br />Universal Studios is a must see.<br />Save by not buying the fast pass just walk past the busy rides the next one won’t be.<br />If you see a queue don’t join it walk to the front and see if there is an alternative (dont push in).<br />Have a great day!","Family","0","","Written March 31, 2019","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

They did have to close Battlestar Galactica Cylon (Blue) for part of the day as it got stuck on launch (ick) but it was fixed.<br /><br />Highly recommend going to see Waterworld and be warned if you sit in the Soak zone you will get soaked (think bucket loads of water) but its full of special effects, fire, jet skis, stunts. <br /><br />We went on:<br />Battlestar Galactica (both red and blue - blue is much better we went 3 times in a row!)<br />The Mummy (love it! AIR CONDITIONED!!!!)<br />Transformers: The Ride (cool 3D effects but quite jolty)<br />Lights, Camera, Action (Actually better than I thought it would be, interesting to see behind film. Caution: wet ride)<br />Canopy Flyer (Chilled out view with your legs dangling but actually quite fun backwards)<br />Puss in boots giant journey (not designed for adults so much but good fun)<br />Madagascar Crate Adventure (kinda sucks but why not...)<br /><br />We ate at the food centre in the jurassic section, it was okay, we had vouchers for free food from the tickets that we bought so I wasn't that bothered about it being overpriced. Good value Souvenirs include getting a cup of soda from one of the stands as its like $5 but you get to take the good quality reusable plastic cup away with you.

We took photos at the globe, checked again the height requirement posted outside of the gate, and walked around for 30 min, all shops still closed. At 9.45 the gate was already opened and we were like 10 in line, better get there sooner next time to be among the 1st (yes, I'm a freak). When it actually opened we (wife, husband, 2 children aged 2 and 4 in stroller), went straight to treasure hunter. We were number 1 there, the children loved it, then we went to mummy area, I forgot what we did here but I didn't remember went into anything because it was not suitable for my children's height. Then we passed the Jurassic park as well because it was opened at 11 and by that time it was still closed. Went straight to enchanted airways, no queque, went straight to the jet coaster, can't believe my 2 yo can be in this quite terrifying jet coaster and she loved it. My 4 yo has been on mild coaster in Disneyland Tokyo and Sea and in her opinion and mine this one is scarier. Went to Shrek 4D also no line (we prioritized these attractions knowing the lines will be long in the afternoon), the kids loved this. Puss in Boot only with my 4 yo, not as scary as the Enchanted airways. She liked this one. My 2 yo was waiting in the shop and can ride small ferris wheel inside (it said opened at 11 but it opened sooner at that time), Then we went to jurassic park at opening at 11 am, most people went straight to the right toward the boat attraction (I forgot the name, but this is the main attraction there) but we went to canopy flyer instead. Also not as scary as the coaster, thought both my children said it was scary. Only small line here, then went to Dino Soar next to it, the children loved this one. My 4 yo and me then went to queque in the boat thing, it said 15 min, but it was 1 hour long. We used our pochos here, glad we did because my child just got better from flu. My 4yo loved this one. She once waited 2 hour in disneyland when she was 3 for the critter attraction (with water splash too) so I know she can handle this one (in heat and patiently). While waiting my husband watched the velociraptor and stayed cool in the foodcourd. I followed them to the foodcourt, ordered the kids menu of dino shaped nuggets and smiley faced fries, the kids loved it. The parents ate chicken rice and it tasted okay really. Then we went to Madagaskar, ate Bingsu (really big) there. The children didn't want to watch Elmo or ride merry go round (strange right?), we went to the attraction on the right thay was like it's a small world though darker. We  went to New York and did the spaghetti chase and live action by Steven Spielberg. The kids loved both but of course the impact of the live! action! was bigger for them. Then we went to Accelerator in Sci Fi just in time to watched Waterworld at 15.45 (the show only has 2 time slots and 16.15 was the last), people actually running for this. And I also followed suit with 1 kid each because we have to leave the stroller near the entrance gate. BUT DUE TO BAD WEATHER THE SHOW WAS CANCELLED AFTER 15 MIN. There was no raining only dark clouds but after watching the rest of the show in you tubes they have lots of fire so I imagined it is possible to get struck by lighting... at least in my mind t<br />it could happen, anyway safety first. We headed home after that. Missed the 3D transformer because my children are tired. It was only 5 pm but it was really humid dan hot. Both then were sleeping, my husband and I walked to Vivo City after took picture with the merlion (they have elevator), it was a really nice walk. We ate at Kushi something there (I recommend not buying the kids menu there because it tasted awful but the adult menu was really good) and  this mall also has a free playground for children.

It has several rides some are high flying rides like Transformers rollercoaster and the Lost world where as the others are slower but equally interesting like 3D ride of Shrek but the best one amongst them was the Spielberg's stand where he takes us inside the making of his own movies (highly recommended).

Collection tickets quick and easy and just like going to any universal or disney anywhere in the world.  I dont know why i went on the 1st rides Battlestar Galactia as I dont have the stomach for roller coasters. Well i was green after them and that was me.  We were obiviously there on a quiet day as we did not use a fasspass on one single ride. Someone was telling us that on a busy day you could wait for an hour per ride.  Transformers 4D was excellent and also a couple of shows. We nipped out for lunch and went back in. Plenty of places to refill your water too.  One comment i would make was the lack of characters throughout the park. If you had young children from 3-12, all they want is to meet them characters and get their photo with them.

Während man dort mittlerweile gut und gerne $100 und mehr für einen Eintritt bezahlt sind es hier gerade mal s$50. Das sollte man sich bewusst sein, wenn man die beiden Parks vergleicht.<br /><br />Wir waren sicher schon 4x in den amerikanischen Universal Studios, weshalb wir unbedingt das asiatische Pendant sehen mussten.<br /><br />Wir waren wochentags da und gönnten uns aufgrund des ""günstigen"" Eintritts den ExpressPass. Über dessen Nutzen waren wir geteilter Meinung. Als Beispiel kamen wir bei Jurassic Park nach 7 Minuten zum Zug während die reguläre Wartezeit 70(!) Minuten betragen hätte. Bei anderen Bahnen war die Wartezeit nur 10 Minuten, weshalb sich kein grosser Vorteil ergab. Die Mitarbeiter gaben sich aber grosse Mühe und setzten uns wenn immer möglich in die erste Reihe. Unter dem Strich ist der Express Pass für uns ein KANN aber kein MUSS. Es gibt einen gewissen Komfort, wir wären an diesem Tag aber auch ohne auf alle Attraktionen gekommen.<br /><br />Auch sonst gefiel uns der Park. Sauber, stimmig und schön gemacht.<br /><br />Die Essens- und Getränkepreise sind sehr gesalzen. Aber das kennt man ja nicht anders :)<br /><br />Wir hatten einen tollen Tag und können dies für Familien, Film- und Achterbahnfans weiterempfehlen.","Couples","0","","Written March 22, 2019","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

До этого не бывали в подобных местах. И, не смотря на то, что давно не дети ( а для детей там просто рай) были в восторге. Билеты позволяют пройти все аттракционы, которые интересны. Мы выбрали «американские горки» «Мумию», «Водный мир». Первое хотелось испытать, но для меня это первый и последний раз. Второе, как развлечение неплохо. Шоу «Водный мир» очень понравилось. Опасные трюки, хорошая подготовка актеров, интересный сюжет. Представления бывают в 12-00 и 16-00 часов. Вообще стоит спланировать маршрут посещения, потому что на самые интересные аттракционы очереди, мы по полчаса отстояли. Сделали много фотографий. Постоянно выходят персонажи мультфильмов - актеры в костюмах- с которыми можно фотографироваться. Выходить за пределы парка можно, сделают отметку на руке, билет не теряйте. Покушать за пределами парка дешевле. Очень много магазинов с тематической продукцией. Без покупки трудно уйти, но цены высокие. Если Вы в Сингапуре и никогда не были таком месте, посетите обязательно.

I have been to the Universal Studios in Florida and sure the park in Florida is bigger and has more stuff to do and see but they did very well with the amount of land they had to work with.  There is enough entertainment in the park to keep you busy all day long.  My kids and I had a memorable  good time and I strongly recommend coming here on your trip to Singapore and Sentosa Island.  It's not rated the number 1 thing to do on Sentosa for nothing.  My 3 kids were ages 4, 10 and 11 when we came here in 2019.","Family","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/16/e2/fe/13/20190315-152348-largejpg.jpg

They are all worth the wait. <br /> We didn’t get in to the park until mid afternoon and it was busy, with some queue time being over 90 minutes. However as the afternoon turned into evening the waiting times got less.<br /> The day we visited there was a parade in the evening and once this had finished the park seemed to empty. This meant that the transformers ride had a 10 minute wait! <br /> I would definitely recommend this as a thing to do while in Singapore. Plan to go maybe first thing after opening and later in the afternoon to miss the crowds. Our ticket allowed us to leave and re-enter on the day purchased.

If you want a special experience the I highly recommend it.  No waiting around in the humid weather to go on rides, your tour guide takes you into special entrances and it is straight on.  These entrances are not the express pass lines, they are even better.  You receive a $15.00 meal voucher on the day too as well as a VIP lanyard that gives you express line privileges after the VIP finishes.You watch the Waterworld show in the comfort of an air conditioned room with great viewing seats.  Our guide (Jet) was great.  He was friendly and knew how to make us feel welcome.  You also get 2 x photo opportunities with characters, our small group picked Transformers and the Madagascar characters.  You only live once so make it special.","","0","","Written March 20, 2019","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

The biggest problem was a rides which are very slow compared to big name attraction parks around the world - Battlestar Galactica was total disaster, very slow and boring  and they have the most stupid regulations – you must leave all your money and bags in locker what is free of charge for one hour, but during day there was  waiting time around one hour, so it is not clear how you can get your bag back if your do not have any money needed to open… Also finger scan was not reliable as system did not recognized original finger, but luckily for us opened the locker with different finger In other attractions there was pin codes that was more reliable, so my guess they were collecting visitors finger scans!  The only ride that 9 year girl find interesting with some adrenaline in the whole park was Revenge of the Mummy, that we did 3 times – stated queue times were not very accurate – for some rides it stated that we must wait 10 minutes, but actual time was around 30 minutes, but for some other attraction there was no queue at all although at the entrance the waiting time was 30 minutes. The only ride we did not manage was Treasure Hunters which had waiting time over 1 hour, but as this was for toddlers we were not disappointed.<br />As the rides were very dull then we spent most of the time in shows – WaterWorld we watched twice in this was top notch performance and I think is the best thing in this attraction park. Lights, Camera, Action!™ Hosted by Steven Spielberg show was short but again impressive with surprises – the biggest problem there was long waiting time. <br />Do not miss Look out! Velociraptors have escaped in Jurassic Park! as they looked very realistic – again great performance.<br />Eating was OK although not cheap, but kid gets some souvenirs at the same time so no need to go outside only to save 5-6 SGD. There is water refill point so bring some empty bottle (they did not checked bags at the entrance at all).<br />And be advised that they have most stupid online booking system that is not simply working – even after transactions is approved by bank there is no tickets issued and luckily – also no money deducted so in the end you need still go to ticket box on buy tickets at the full price – might be mastercard server problem as Resorts World Sentosa are relying on mastercard – for me it looked that mastercard is using very old online system.<br />So in the end we spend around 8 hours in park, shows were great, also park was clean and staff was superbly friendly and smiling but because of rides I would not recommend to visit universal studio – there are much more better things to do in Singapore or in Sentosa Resort. Maybe if this is your first attraction park or you have toddlers, then you can have different experience.","Family","0","","Written March 20, 2019","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

I am NOT an adrenaline seeking person so to me the rides are pretty good. Didnt managed to try the most exciting cyclone ride as the waiting time was extended to 70mins on a weekday. The shrek dragon ride gave me quite abit of adrenaline. The mummy ride seems familiar to 1 of the rides i took at Tokyo DisneySea. Went to the Elmo show where its catered to mainly kids. Language used is English. Elmo ride will be very good for toddlers too. The Madagascar ride had a ""scary"" ending. Haha the 2 tourists were scrambling for umbrella/ponchos when the cart we were in was approaching a mini waterfall, afraid of being drenched in water. You will understand what i mean after you have taken the ride. Food inside was quite expensive. I ate a burger with fries set costing S$15. There are water dispensers available amongst the park so if you want to save on beverage, just bring an empty water bottle and you will do fine. Overall i think you will be able to take all the rides within a day during weekdays. Just bear in mind of the scorching sun.

A big Thumbs up for the staff at the park. They really are most welcoming and helpful staff I have ever met. The park has a reasonable number of rides which gives you time to enjoy your day at leisure without having to run around so as not to miss rides. We got the tickets from Klook so really hassle free. I don't find it worth taking the cable car to there. The Sentosa express is just find. We did not get the express pass and it was just fine as it was week day. The queues were manageable. Some tips:<br /><br />- Everyone rushes to the Transformers ride as soon as the park opens. We did too and waited for almost 1 hour. However at around noon waiting time was only 5 mins. So better wait to go during the day.<br />- The Waterworld show is amazing. Do check the timing and plan your day such that you don't miss it.<br />- There are raincoats on sale for SGD 5 at the shop next to the Jurassic park rapids adventure. Do get it you won't regret. We wish we saw if before our ride. Our clothes and shoes were all drenched. But don't miss this ride. It's really great.<br />- The queue did not seem to end at the Cylon ride. But The Human roller coaster was around 5 mins waiting time during the last hour before the park closes.<br />- The transformers roll out and Madagascar show is also really great","Family","0","","Written March 19, 2019","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

This was worth it as you literally walk right to the front of any ride, sit where you want and move onto the next. This meant my elderly mum did not have to stand in the heat (there’s only two seasons in Singapore: hot and super hot!). On rides she could not sit on, they had air-con family rooms for her to rest whilst she waited for us. Private guide took us around in 4 hrs, and we essentially covered all the park and rides in that time<br /><br />Would I pay the same amount again with friends- absolutely not. The premium is too much. But if you have a mixture of young children and elderly folk to look after at the same time, it was worth paying for to keep everyone happy.

We went on a Wednesday and the longest we waited was 30minutes, but that was for the rapids ride, it seemed super popular. The waterworld show was the best.

There was plenty of choice though.  <br /><br />Recommend hiring a locker it was only $16 for all day.

We pondered on buying express pass (it was 110$ eash) and finally bought it. But still our group return time was 6.30. We decided to stay back and we had super fun. <br />So imp getaways:<br />1. plan the visit on weekday when the studio is less crowded.<br />2. if you visit on holiday and you have already spent lot on travel, spend some more on express tickets, rather than waiting in line for hours.<br />3. Do checkout the parade etc, it's super fun for kids.<br />Have fun!!","Family","0","","Written March 16, 2019","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

We unfortunately were delayed in our arrival here so only had about 5 and 1/2 hrs at the park (closes at 7pm mon-thur). <br /><br />We tried to go on as many rides as possible which was tricky since a lot of them had long wait/queue times, some even up to 90 mins!<br /><br />Managed to go on about 5 rides. They have a few smaller rides aimed at younger children which aren’t that wild or scary. I went on the puss in boots ride which was a rollercoaster and lots of fun. The Shrek 4D And transformers 4D were also very clever. I went on one of the large Sci-Fi City rollercoasters (Battlestar Galactica CYLON grey track) that goes upside down 5 times and has a corkscrew. Misleading wait time said 10 mins but was actually closer to 45 mins as the wait time indicator board outside wasn’t computerised and had to be updated manually and obviously hadn’t been updated for a while. This ride unfortunately made me feel so sick afterwards that I couldn’t enjoy the rest of the rides I went on afterwards. <br /><br />Lots of gift shops, overpriced and also many of the deals require you to purchase multiple products from a range rather than single items. <br /><br />Food choices aren’t great and also overpriced. We were fortunate to get a $5 food voucher when we purchased our tickets online beforehand so these made our $16 meal go down to $11. <br /><br />The waterworld stunt show was impressive but a bit too violent for my liking. There are labelled seating areas in the auditorium which specify if you will get splashed on, drenched with water or stay dry as the show takes place in water. <br /><br />A fun day out!","Couples","0","","Written March 15, 2019","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

We went on a weekday and arrived right as gates open which is highly recommended. Lines for rides that aren’t as popular were short. But lines for some rides were 30+ minutes wait. If you don’t like waiting, would definitely recommend the express lane pass as I would get it if I was to return. Food was pricey but that’s typical for theme parks. Totally recommend the Waterworld show, it is amazing.

Singapore is a place well worth visiting. We had a great trip to Singapore.<br />    The place that impressed me most in this tour was Universal Studios. Every event here was interesting, so there was a long queue for almost every event. My sister and I enjoy doing exciting things, so we lined up for the roller coaster. After about half an hour, we began to play the roller coaster. I felt very excited when the roller coaster was climbing. The car began to accelerate and I heard a deafening scream. I like the scenery when the roller coaster was high, I like the blue sky and the white clouds. If you do not want to play exciting games, there are many other projects here, and you can always find the right one.<br />    In the afternoon of that day, we watched a 4D movie in Universal Studios. 4D movies are a feature of Universal Studios. It is very cool! I felt like that I was in the film. The chairs in the cinema would move with the action and would occasionally blow. It was so interesting that many spectators shouted out. If you come to Singapore, highly suggest you come here.<br />If you don not want to play in fun parks, you can walk along the beach in Singapore, the sand is very soft here. Of course, you can also swim in the sea.<br />    Again, Singapore is a place worth visiting, you can come here and spend your holiday.","Family","0","","Written March 9, 2019","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

We opted to rent a small locker, prices were $12 for 4 hours or $16 for the day and located right inside entrance gates. You can open the locker throughout the day if needs be. At many attractions you can’t bring anything on with you and there are free lockers for short term use but we found it easier to put everything away and only get things out as needed. We were impressed at the effort to shade much of the park but I would still pack sun cream. As we visited on a week day the queues weren’t too bad but the popular attractions did crowd so we chose to wait until the end of day for the big roller coasters and were rewarded with a 10 minute wait. We are in the Madagascar food court and were disappointed but there are many other options in the park. Water is $4 so be prepared to purchase a few throughout the day. Also if you plan to go on the Jurassic park wet ride bring sandals so your runners don’t get wet and everyone on the attraction got wet. In the gift shops we also received a 10% discount for using Master Card, not sure if this was a temporary promo but he sure to ask. Great park with a lot of attractions for all ages. Highly recommend.","Couples","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/16/ae/a0/d6/universal-studios-singapore.jpg

Recommended if you guys could book the Theme park and a hotel together.","","0","","Written March 1, 2019","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

The restroom amenities were spotless for such a busy park. The only disappointment was the food in the American diner. Poor quality salad, with a few tough bits of chicken on top, the chicken burger was not much better.

This is my second time in Universal Studios, 1st time was in LA.<br /><br />There is a lot of different things to do for everyone. If you don’t like the rides you can always go around the area and watch those live performances/shows or go to Pantages theatre to see Sesame Street mini musical. <br />Or you can go and watch Shrek 4D movie experience. <br /><br />The rides are amazing! There is two big rollercoasters, Mummy ride, Transformers ride and lots of other rides for you to take. <br />There is also two water rides which I didn’t took. <br /><br />In Water World show make sure you know which areas are “soaked”, “might get wet” and so called safe zones. <br /><br />After I took Mummy and Transformers ride I was so amused and caught my self thinking how did they do that with all the visual effects and 3D videos. You just have to experience it. They were amazing. <br /><br />Even though Singapore is the most expensive city in Asia and the express pass at Universal Studios sets you back 129S$ (79S$ admission + 50S$ express pass) I’d say it’s worth it. I was in the Universal Studios on Monday before noon and there was already 40 minutes lines to some rides. Later afternoon the waiting times were 40-75 minutes so it’s nice to cut the line with express pass. I can imagine the amount of people there on weekends and holidays. <br /><br />You can bring your own food and drinks to area. The food they sell there is not very good and drinks are quite highly priced but that’s how amusement parks work. I had an average burger combo for 16S$.<br /><br />My recommendations:<br />- Transformers ride<br />- Lights! Camera! Action! by Steven Spielberg<br />- Water World stunt show. <br />- Mummy ride<br />- Two big rollercoasters<br />- Puss in Boots ride<br />","Solo","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/16/95/8a/9f/photo1jpg.jpg

We rode another couple & went back to the rides to be told they were testing the rides. Didn't start taking passengers until 10.30ish. Later on at about 11.30, we went to another ride to be told via an announcement that the ride had temporarally closed to add more carriages. This should not have happened, these should have been tested & added to the rides before opening.<br />Apart from that, the park is clean, smaller with fewer rides than others.

The only day this is possible really is Saturday as the park is open until 10pm!! This means short queues, no melting on the pavement, and no one blocking your shots. It also means most food stalls, places to eat, and on ride photo counters are also shut. But if you’re okay with this CANNOT recommend enough. I mean go during the day too to get the most of your ticket! But don’t bother waiting in an 80 minute line that you’ll be able to walk straight onto that night! :) Also. If you’ve been to Universal Studios in Hollywood- this park is much much smaller with not nearly as many attractions, which may be underwhelming.

If you are an adrenaline junkie, you surely don't want to miss out on places like this!<br /><br />Even if you're with your family, there are some rides which even they can enjoy and aren't fueled with scares. If you're visiting Singapore, do not even think about missing this one! You'll need a whole day here, so make sure you add this to your itinerary.<br /><br />Special mention rides...<br /><br />The Mummy: This one was one hell of a ride. First you need to take a long walk inside the structure and then there you reach to a dark cave like roller coaster which takes you to the Egyptian times taking you up down and all the sides in high speed in the dark. Gosh!!! Still can't get over it...went 2 times in this 😉<br /><br />Transformers: The best 4D experience ever! The moving coaster with 3D screens literally made us feel that we are in middle of the fight. This one is even 10 times better than the one at Ferrari World Abu Dhabi. Greatest advantage of this ride is that even the elder people can enjoy this who are scared of roller coasters. It will be a supreme delight for them.<br /><br />Jurassic world: (EXPECT A VERY LONG WAITING TIME) Yeah, you read the brackets right! We waited for almost 2 hrs in the queue. It's a tube boat coaster which takes you through the jurassic jungle with robotic dinosaurs. After experiencing it, I felt like it's here from where the inspiration for The Rajasaurus ride in Imagica has been taken from. If you've been to Rajasaurus in Imagica, it's pretty much the same but in open air and a few bumps in the river like in tube slides in a water park.<br /><br />There were 2 high speed roller coasters as well (forgot their names). The red line coaster was fast but not awesome kinds.<br />The grey line takes your breath away by swirling you around and taking you through the ground between the fog! Grey one was awesome!<br /><br />In all, it was a fantastic day at Universal Studios Singapore!","Family","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/16/8b/ff/ae/img-20190217-142454-largejpg.jpg

Cy-Lon is the most hardcore it gets in this park so plan accordingly.<br /><br />I rode everything worth riding:<br /><br />Sesame Street coaster - is good for kids; but over really too quickly ,;D<br />Transformers Ride - surprised the kids weren't freaked out, really good '4D' ride<br />Puss n' Boots coaster - kid friendly but throws the stomach around more than you'd think<br />The Mummy Ride - it's fast-ish coaster ride in the dark, and not much of the horror house 'BOO' as I would have wanted. <br />Jurassic Park - good, over very quickly and you may well get wet. Bring a parka<br />Battlestar Galactica: HUMAN - might be at your limit if you're not into 'coasters<br />Battlestar Galactica: CY-LON - might be at your limit or just beyond. Because of the loops and screws, it's more disorienting than HUMAN, for some that means 'NO WAY' but I thought the G's were more noticeable on HUMAN.

I’m not a rollercoaster fan, King Julien of Madagascar’s carousel is up my street, that said I foolishly ignored the warnings for the Mummy ride and have since vowed never to go on such a ride again! The Transformers 4D simulations is one of the best of it’s kind in my opinion and we went on it twice!

For the past year and a half, since moving to Singapore, my family has held season passes to Universal Studios. <br /><br />The park does a really nice job of keeping things current and having special holiday programming. “Halloween horror nights” for example, is very well done. They turn some of the non-ride areas into themed haunted houses. <br />* please note that there is an extra charge for Halloween horror nights even for passholders. In general this is for teens or adults and can be VERY frightening for younger children. <br /><br />We have gone Universal enough times to make the passes worthwhile! We really enjoy all of the rides as they are generally good for a range of children ages 8 to 18 (of course there are also a few rides for smaller children). <br /><br />When buying a season pass, definitely consider the Express Pass. This will allow you to bypass the general admission line and get on the rides quicker. For certain rides, they have a “single rider,” which means if your party wants to stand together in line, but doesn’t care if you go on the same ride at the same time, you can also bypass longer lines. <br />* Not every ride has “express” or “single rider” options.<br /><br />The park is always very clean and the rides seem to be operated safely. The food is usually decent but overpriced since it is a theme park. Do note that some vendors don’t take credit cards and only deal in Singapore cash. Specifically, the iced-slushy vendor - which is a favorite.  <br /><br />The Indian food set across from the mummy ride is very good, my kids love the Dino nuggets near Jurassic Park, and my kids like the green Shrek waffles.<br /><br />The Transformers ride is a three-dimensional experience so be wary if you get motion sick. I always take 1/2 of a Dramamine before going to this park so that I can enjoy all of the adventure rides happily!<br /><br />Also note, you will get WET on the Jurassic park River Adventure! Your stuff will get WET on the Jurassic Park River Adventure. Your raft will flood. So, bring a plastic garbage bag, or rain poncho if you don’t want you and your things to get wet, and don’t put anything on the floor of the raft.  <br /><br />Enjoy Universal!","Family","0","","Written February 13, 2019","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

Not to miss is the cyclone ride, the mummy ride in the Egyptian area and the water show. On the outside,  do visit the Hershey’s store for all who love chocolates . There are a lot of shops for souvenirs too. ","Friends","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/16/6a/df/ad/photo3jpg.jpg

However once the masses arrived, we couldn't get on some rides we wanted as the queuing time was more than 70 to 90 minutes for each. So in the afternoon we went on the less popular rides, but still needed to queue for around 30 to 40 minutes. If you don't paying more than double for your ticket then you can get the express pass ticket and queue for longer, but we didn't feel this was right and everyone should have had a chance to get a faster ticket for 1 or 2 rides even with the ordinary ticket!","","0","","Written February 9, 2019","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

Tiketnya bisa dibeli langsung di USS atau membeli melalui Traveloka/Klook (biasanya lebih murah melalui online). Perjalanan dari tengah kota ke Sentosa bisa menggunakan MRT ke Stasiun Harbourfront lalu menaiki Sentosa Express dengan biaya 4 SGD. Selain menggunakan Sentosa Express terdapat satu alternatif yang lebih murah yaitu menggunakan bis. Bis yang biasa dipakai yaitu RWS208 bisa naik melalui bus stand yang ada di Vivo City Shopping, biayanya 1 SGD. Sayangnya, kalian harus menyediakan waktu yang lebih untuk menunggu bis menuju Sentosa.<br />Tips ke USS agar bisa mencoba semua wahana adalah sampai disana pagi-pagi lalu langsung mengantri di depan pintu masuk. Masuki dulu wahana yang biasanya ramai diserbu orang seperti Transformer dan Revenge of the Mummy (kalau sudah antriannya mengular biasanya mennggu hingga lebih dari 1 jam). Jangan lupa mambawa botol minum, di USS banyak sekali tempat untuk mendapatkan air. Selain itu, disarankan untuk membawa payung karena panas atau berjaga-jaga apabila hujan. Bawa juga uang yang berlebih, karena di dalam USS terdapat toko-toko souvenir yang lucu-lucu meskipun terkadanga harganya pricey dan makanan serta minuman yang dijual juga cenderung lebih mahal. Setidaknya makan dan minum saja harus merogoh kocek 10 SGD. Untuk yang suka banget makanan India, di USS ada toko makanan India yang menurut saya enak. Porsi makanannya pun besar dengan harga 16 SGD, untuk para wanita bisa makan berdua. <br />Selamat menikmati liburan di USS!","Friends","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/16/66/85/d6/photo7jpg.jpg

I wanted to go to universal Singapore just for the heck of it because I have been to both in the United States and thought “why not?”. But to be fair, I got through this park in an afternoon. The transformers and mummy ride were the best, the duelling roller coaster was alright. If your bored in Singapore and looking for an afternoon of something to do it’s kind of fun to see, just don’t expect to be blown away by thrill rides as it’s a pretty small park.

After googling, it appears this happens frequently and it does not surprise me as it rains in Singapore more often than not.<br />I mean, I get it, it makes sense. But I post this for others to think about this when choosing when to go and why.<br />We had the longest queues on that day and a long wait until 10:15 pm on the heat with the kids only to be dissapointed after announcements of delays and then cancellations of the special events the whole day.<br />Anyways, if you are a fan of theme parks like us, you'd do the park twice. Then on the bright side, you can upgrade your ticket to a seasonal pass for only 30 SGD and go again and again if your stay allows. Just go to the membership office next to the entrance during your visit and in ten minutes you walk out with your card, even if you are a tourist! Not that the queues are much shorter on short days, though.","Family","0","","Written February 3, 2019","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

(For all ages) ,,,   Enjoy my detail Review","Here is my detail review of Universal Studio Singapore ,  which will help you and guide you ,  (please give a thumbs up if you like it ) , <br /><br />1)  Its located at world resort sentosa ,   you can go there easily by Taxi ,  Grab Taxi ,,  or  by  any tour guide service or  by cable car  from Vivo Mall ,  <br /><br />2)  we took Grab taxi , which charged me around 12 S$  from orchid road ,  (me ,  my wife and a 2 year toddler) , <br /><br />3) I didn't chose  any guide service ,  because they would pickup me at hotel around 8 30 am ,  and  just drop me there ,  no service back to hotel ,     so I chose grab taxi (UBER) , and went there with ease , and cheap , <br /><br />4) Taxi dropped us at basement ,  we took elevator<br /><br />5)  there are  4 to 5 windows for tickets  ,  i went there on 23rd dec  (peak time of tourists) ,  it was like  30 people at the queue , but it was moving fast , due to 5 windows , <br /><br />6)  we bought 1 express pass (120 $) ,  1 normal pass (80 $)  ,    (toddler ticket  free) ,  we really made mistake in buying the tickets ,  , which i will tell you later <br /><br />7)   this theme park consist of 6 themes ,  from entrance if you go left , you will find Madagascar ,  or  if you go right from entrance , you will find hollywood , and seasame street , <br /><br />8)  I preferred to kick-off my visit by going left ,  (Madagascar) ,  <br /><br />9)  there was a slow boat ride ,  (toddler can enjoy as well) ,  but there were  sooo many people ,   express queue was only 10 people ,   but normal queue was like 100 to 150 people ,  we can't take the express queue  as we only have  1 express ,   it took us  1 hour for normal queue ,  <br /><br />10)  so if you going in holiday period or weekends ,  i strongly recommend the express pass ,   1 time express is around 120 $ ,   unlimited  express is around 220$ ,    <br /><br />11)  for 1 time time express , they will provide a card with  all rides names mentioned ,  when you take any ride from express queue ,  they just tik the name of that ride , so that we cannot use it again  by express , <br /><br />benefit was that m my wife  enjoyed few rides so did I also enjoyed the remaining , <br /><br />12)  but unlimited pass , the just tied a band on your wrist ,   so that  only  1 person can use it , <br /><br />13)  well , after Madagascar ,   we went to Sherk theme,  which was ok , if not  best , ,  <br /><br />14)  then  we went to lost world theme ,  beautifully build ,  there is stunt show  3 times a day ,  which was really amazing , (i dnt remember the timings ) ,  <br /><br />15)  there was a also a slow merry-go-round ride  which was perfect for my toddler , <br /><br />16)  the we enter the Egypt mummy theme area ,    wow ,  what a splendid architecture , <br /><br />17) there was a dark horror ride , which was really awesome and scary , but not recommend for toddler <br /><br />18)  all theme parks  have restaurants ,   egypt theme park  have  halaal indian restaurant as well , i think only  2 halal restaurant in entire USS <br /><br />19)   then we enter science fiction theme area ,     we has  best ride of USS ,   called  transporter ,   we enter that area around 4 pm ,  there was not much long queue at transporter ,  (there is a TIP  ,  this ride also has a option for single person queue , which is also shorter  same as express pass queue , ) ,  <br /><br />20)  then we enter hollywood area,   beautifully built ,  there was artificial snow there sometimes ,  really amazing ,   must see the ""light-camera-action show directed by Steven Spielberg,     and sesame street ride ""spaghetti"", recommended for toddlers  , <br /><br />21)  there was huge  parade in the evening , with all USS characters, <br /><br />22) there were also arcade games area in hollywood theme, <br /><br /> we didn't finished all 6 parks completely , but if you buy express pass , u can finish the park for sure , <br /><br />My TIPS ,  <br /><br />1)  Dont take any guide service , it will bound you to go early morning , <br /><br />2) Begin the park from left ,  ""madagascar"" ,  then you will finish it on hollywood in the evening ,  which look really wonderful  in evening , <br /><br />3) go for express pass  if you have money ,  you can enjoy all rides  in a day , <br /><br />4)  don't go for unlimited pass ,  as its too expensive ,  and there are too many rides to enjoy , no sense to enjoy just 1 ride time to time , <br /><br />5) wear rain coat in jurrasic park boat ride , which they sell at 5$ ,  otherwise you may go soaked , <br /><br />6) you can get rental stroller for toddler on cheap rates at entrance , <br /><br />7)  exit the park 30 mins  before , inorder to have short queue at taxi , (but GRAB  is the best option there , cheap and hassle free) , <br /><br />8) you can also exit park and re-enter  at any time,  but believe me  you dont have time to exit ,    there are lots of activities etc there ,   even with express park , you can't ride everything or enjoy all shows , <br /><br />Please ask any question , i will answer you , <br /><br />Give this review a thumbs up , if its help you  "") <br /><br />Pardon my weak english (Hahahha)","Family","0","","Written February 1, 2019","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of

Of all the trips, I would have to say that Today was the most disappointing trip of all. Madagascar 4D Experience was good itself but the park should think about getting guides who can speak proper English. The girl was not able to enunciate her words properly and even me as a Singaporean found it hard to understand her. What about foreigners? Jurassic rapid ride- what happened to the t rex stimulation at the end before we dropped? Was kind of boring without that part. The water show was under renovation. The transformers ride had a glitch in the middle where there was no lights or sounds . We were left in the dark for like 10 seconds. I went again during the evening and it worked fine then. People were not the friendliest around the park. If you can't deal with crowds then please don't work there. You should think about having controlled entry into the park. Have a limit of visitors. The maximum q was like 1.5 hours today but why would anyone want to spend that amount on a busy day with so little rides. Really quite a turn off.","Friends","0","","Written January 24, 2019","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

Lines were about 30-45mins long but we didn’t go on the big attractions like the Battlestar Galactica or Transformers which had lines over an hour long. However I really recommend getting the Xpress pass so you get more out of your day and don’t have to deal with whining kids. <br /><br />My main gripe from the day was the Sesame Street show, which my 3 year old was really getting into. Then for some reason, halfway through, it stopped suddenly and we were told to leave the building with no reason given other than a “technical difficulty.” I really think that for supposedly being an “award winning stage show” the actors should have been professional enough to keep going and improvise, instead of disappointing hundreds of little kids with no proper explanation given. <br /><br />For food- there are lots of over priced Chinese or deep fried options around. I’d recommend stepping out of there and exploring all the other options close by. <br /><br />In terms of kids- Toilets are always close by and all seemed to have a baby change facility. Prams are handy to have as there is a lot of walking to do for little feet, otherwise you can also hire one. There are drink fountains everywhere so it might be advantageous to bring some water bottles in and fill them up while you’re there to save $ (drinks are expensive in there!). Im thankful we brought in little fans with a mist spray as it got hot in the lines and the kids would have something else to complain about.<br /><br />We ended up spending about 8 hours there and could have easily spent longer if the kids weren’t so tired. It was an expensive day out but in the end I think we got our money’s worth. A must do in Sentosa. <br />","Family","0","","Written January 23, 2019","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

Every ride had at least 1 hour 15 minutes wait and there was minimal shaded areas. We ended up paying to enter The park completed a lap of the park and then left. We were under the impression that it was film sets and behind the scenes looks rather than rides and theme park style games ( that’s on us for not researching more I guess). <br /><br />It was a great atmosphere we were just disappointed by the waiting times. I think families with young ones would love it just get up early to miss the masses. <br /><br />Overall great looking and interesting attractions we just didn’t go at the best time.

Some of the rides had up to a 120 minute wait, and getting a seat in the eating areas proved almost impossible.

Bought the tickets via klook.com. bought the express tkts too after all the reviews. We lined up in the priority line at 9.30 and felt pretty special considering the lines for normal were getting bigger. They gave us a show time pamphlet in line so had time to sort out the plan of attack. Rides first based on other reviews. Here they are <br /> Transformers # 5<br />Revenge of mummy<br />Battlestar galactica human.. cyclon is worse. Me.. human only #1 🤢<br />Jurassic park water ride  #6<br />Shrek 4d # 3<br />Waterworld ... first show at 1pm<br />Lights camera action # 4<br />Madagascar<br />Puss in boots<br />Canopy flyer #2<br /><br />I didnt go on revenge of mummy bc after human i felt a little queasy all day. Loved transformers and should have gone on jurassic park earlier. Yes u will get wet... but id ur wearing quik dry ull be okay...  anyway having the express pass helped us at this ride and a few others .  by the time we got at jurassic park  the wait for normal was 80 mins. We waited 20 mins max.<br />So i suggest rides then shows, meet and greets if u like then shops. Its not a big place but leave shopping till last. <br />We had lunch at 11.30 at mels diner.  Cost about $ 80 for small portions of food for four but no one in there and no waiting time. Started to get busy about 12.15. Great atmosphere tho. The place is clean.

It wasn't super packed but busy enough for queues to get to 45-60 min wait without express pass at certain points in the day.  Because we like the more extreme roller coasters (and not fans of queuing in the humidity), we got the express pass unlimited.  Longest queue we were ever in for any ride was 10 min.  We went to Battlestar Galactica Human and Cylon rides first.  With the express pass, we were able to ride both once before the rides shut down due to technical issue.  They thankfully reopened later in the afternoon but had they not, we would have been very appreciative of having the express pass.  The Waterworld show was fun to watch.  This Universal Studios is quite small compared to the one in Orlando, so you could probably get through everything in half a day (with express pass).  We rode everything multiple times (some rides many times) and found enough fun to spend the entire park opening hours there.  The park gets noticeably quieter around 5 pm when families with small kids start heading off. The rides that require no bags or loose items will have free locker rental.  The amount of free locker rental time is adjusted throughout the day in accordance with queuing time.  For example for Human/Cyclon, at park opening the free locker time was 45 min.  At 2 pm, it was 95 min.  At 5 pm, it was 65 min.  On rides where lockers are optional (i.e. Rapids), you will have to pay (i.e. $4 for 1 hour).  We took a Grab car on the way there, and a taxi back to our hotel.  Both Grab and taxi were about the same cost for two people as using public transportation, but took half the travel time and provided gloriously cool air con.  Bring your own water...there are lots of drinking fountains but the water was low/warm/not great tasting.  Buying water is $4 for a small carton.  Don't run - witnessed lots of groups throughout the day running from ride to ride - you'll make it without running with time to spare on a weekday!  Safety first!","Couples","0","","Written January 17, 2019","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

If you do get soaked, there are drying cabinets at the end of the ride, but they slug you $5 for that as well. <br />All in all an enjoyable day, the rides are ok but not many for adrenaline junkies.

It ends up costing just over 2 days admission with unlimited express, and while you don't get unlimited express entry (just once per visit) it means that you can just keep going for half days throughout your stay on Sentosa island and just ride each ride once (express) per entry!<br />We purchased the season pass in advance and then on the first day we used the printed ticket to enter the park and then went to the membership office to convert the pass into a season pass which was a credit card sized card with our photo on it (photos taken in the membership office and our passports required for all tickets incl kids to do this!).

The only irritating part there is the very long queue to get into the rides. You have to wait in the queue for more than an hour sometimes. However, if you get the VIP ticket, you can get the priority to enter. But still there is queue as quite a number of people buy VIP tickets. I loved the roller coaster, The Mummy and transformers. Foods are way too expensive. Water costs about SGD7 for 350ml/500ml (can't remember). The entry ticket price varies from one website to other. But if you purchase ticket directly from the counter there is expensive, compare to the internet price. Better you purchase ticket online as some of the offers include transports.<br /><br />If you want to try all the rides, it will take your whole day. There is no point going to universal studios at 8am. It opens at 10am. You can start at 9am after taking a nice breakfast. You can take photos outside and then wait in the queue to enter. Do not carry any food items with you as they through all food items. They check your backpacks at the entrance. But you can carry water bottle. And you must carry water bottle otherwise you have to spend quite a lot money on water.<br /><br />Before going to queue for any roller coaster, make sure you get a locker. Otherwise you have to come all the way out to put your stuffs in the locker and be the queue all over again. The locker is free for 1st one hour I guess, then it's chargeable. So if you are travelling more than one person, take one locker and keep all your belongings and then after an hour or one ride get another locker with another person thumb print.<br /><br />I hope the tips will help you to travel well.<br /><br />","Couples","0","","Written January 16, 2019","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

The queues for rides differed in time based on the popularity of the ride and time of the day; e.g.: the Battlestar Galactica 'Human' ride took over 1.5 hours in the afternoon, whereas the Mummy ride was only 10 minutes near 6pm. <br /><br />The main issue with the park is one expected of every park; food and drinks are overpriced (but not when considering prices in other theme parks). <br /><br />I recommend using a pin when accessing a locker as fingerprints are removed from the system once your session expires; we needed to ask for it to be opened by a worker but they were excellent in their service (as most employees were). <br /><br />If you were to go in a busy season, I recommend paying the extra money for an express pass to make the most of your day and access more rides (especially if you have children or large groups).

Go early","We did this on the last day of our Singapore holiday. By then I realised the locals all sleep in and you need to go early. We got to the gates at 9.30am ready to open at 10am. As soon as they opened the gates (actually a few mins before advertised 10am) we ran to the rollercoasters. The first 3 rides had zero queue. Jurassic world opened at 11am so we made sure we were first one of the canopy ride. By lunch time the wait times were 1 hour for all the good rides. If you go, you must begin at 10am sharp and rush through all the good rides first. Plan with the map where to go so you don't waste time. If you are going to start later and don't plan I don't think you will like it unless you really enjoy standing in lots of queues in the heat.

Bringing four kids (aged one half months to 6 years old) was challenging (given the Singapore heat) but overall the visit to USS was a very pleasant experience. <br />Pros:<br />- Very good toilet facilities. having lots of water coolers all over the park helped saved a ton of money as we did not have to buy the pricey soft drinks. <br />- Going at a off peak period, it was generally enjoyable as the smaller rides were empty. This is very good for families with young kids, generally we did not have to wait more than 5-10 minutes (without express pass).<br />- Park was stroller friendly and the generally small size of the park meant that we could revisit places we missed pretty easily.<br />- Friendly staff and the ""child swop"" option allowed us to take turns to join our kids on certain rides without having to queue all over again.<br /><br />Tips to enjoy the park<br />- Bring a water tumbler. Given the hot Singapore weather, you will need to top up your bottle at least 4-5 times a day. Having a water tumbler saves money on buying pricey soft drinks. <br />- The food in the USS premises is very expensive, just go out of the park to eat and you save at least $5-$6 per meal. It takes less than 15 minutes to reach the entrance from the farthest point of the park. If you are like us with a family of 6, you get to save at least $40-$50 just by walking a little more<br />- Have a late breakfast or eat something substantial before you go into the park (assuming at 10am). That way you can have your lunch about 2-3pm in which you are able to avoid the sizeable lunch crowd.<br />- If there are certain rides you want to take but couldn't because of the long queue, go during the water world show (at 1pm or 415pm) as that the period where many visitors are watching the show thus considerably shortening the queue at those rides.","Family","0","","Written January 10, 2019","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

At the very beginning it was still possible to access the rides quickly. Later the day the wait was up to one and a half hours for the beat rides. That was also due to the fast track which does not cost too much, if I remember and allows you to skip to the front of the line. I get the point, but it was super annoying, especially due to the locker system. They want you to put backpacks into lockers. Depending on how busy the park is, the time varies (more time for free in the evening). You get like 45 min for free and if you’re not back in time, you have to pay for rent and it’s not too cheap. The problem is, I left my cash and cards in the locker and due to long lines took longer than 45 min. A nice gentlemen lend us a couple of dollars to get the stuff out and then we could pay back.

If you're considering an Express Pass, and lack patience standing in lines like I do, then go ahead and get one. For the rides recommend the Transformers 3D ride as a 'must do' and for families - Shrek 4D. Despite the heavy rain in the afternoon the Battlestar Gallactica roller coaster kept running and although by the end of it I was soaking wet I was more than satisfied with the SCARE factor. This is not a cheap day out but it is one you will remember for a long time to come.","Couples","0","","Written January 9, 2019","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

The long queues at every show/ride was at least half an hour, hence unbearable under the heat and high humidity. It was quite a tortuous experience for me. Though my son was able to acclimatize quite quickly to SG weather, but he did find the queues unbearably long under the heat.  He enjoyed the Water World Show and the Merry Go Round. He said that the roller coaster rides were too scary for a 9 year old. We were not able to go to every show/rides because we spent so much time queuing up, and by 6 pm, my son was dead tired. I would have bought the Express ticket if I had known of the option. Of the places we went to in Singapore, he rated this place last. It was also the most pricey of all the places we went to. He liked the cable car trip to and fro Sentosa. <br />Food: quite pricey within USS, you could have got cheaper option just outside the USS compound. We did not take the latter option because of the long queues at every show/rides.<br />The queue may not be quite so long outside Singapore school holidays - but will never find out as we will not be returning.<br />The next day, we came to Sentosa again by train and he had a great time at the Pirate Ship water play at Palawan Beach, free entry. He told me that he enjoyed his time at the Pirate Ship much more than at USS. Food at Palawan Beach was cheaper. Good facility for kids water play here.","Family","0","","Written January 8, 2019","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

В общем, парк был лишним, он настолько проще своих европейских аналогов, что ради него лететь точно не стоит. Очень много народу, есть фаст пасс, по одному проходу на аттракцион, но даже и там очереди , иногда до 1,5 часов. Реально необычное было только одно - шоу трансформеров. Погода дождливая, при первых каплях закрывают все горки, из-за этого потом гигантские очереди. Вывод такой - если вы в Сингапуре оставили лишний день, погода солнечная, можно сходить. Но ожидать что-то типа Порт Авентуры не стоит. Там же на острове огромный океанариум, вот на него точно стоит потратить время. А может, сам Сингапур просто такой классный, что парк просто померк на его фоне...","Family","0","","Written January 8, 2019","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

Entered with park opening at 10:00 AM and left at 12:00 midnight when park closed, yet I missed so much - true one day isn't enough to explore the park, even with express pass, especially when you are with 4 year old kid and have to swap kid for certain rides with your partner.<br />Transformer, mummy, battlestar galactica - cylon were notably the best rides while my kid enjoyed madagascar and king julien merry go round. I was able to watch only one show and man what a show - Waterworld was like you were watching a movie being shot in front of you, of course without any retakes.<br />For food there are plenty of options, Oasis was my choice because of vegetable options too. One could walk out of USS too for cheaper options but then that's a trade-off between money and time.<br />Finally beautiful firework along with DJs was the best way to open your arms to a new year.<br /><br />Tips: later of the day sees smaller queues everywhere especially when park is running for long hours. Ponchos are must on a rainy day and battlestar doesn't operate at such times. Taking a stroller is a very good idea with a little kid. Water is available everywhere to refill your bottle.","","0","","Written January 8, 2019","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

As a Singaporean, I’m seriously ashamed that the guests to my country are being tortured AND ripped off at the same time.

There are certainly a number of decent rides and queues do form early straight after park opening. However, the heat is a real factor. You get a bit unenthusiastic after awhile for joining long queues. Maybe locals can handle it better.  Individual mileage will differ for overseas visitors. You can purchase an express pass once inside the park to skip queues but on the day of our visit, it was S$70 extra which was only a little less than the normal park admission. You really have to want to ride those rides multiple times to justify that amount of money. Word of advice, queue up for transformer ASAP. You can also re-enter the park multiple times (just get a stamp) so you can go out, get lunch at the gentrified hawker centre and then go back in. The park feels smaller than the one in LA or is it just more compact?","Family","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/15/fc/eb/ba/mvimg-20181217-130915.jpg

Be aware that your pockets need to be empty (no phone, wallets, etc) and there are lockers nearby for storage. <br /><br />Be wary of queue jumpers: many large families (5+) individuals saw it as their right to hold a position in the line for all members with one individual. On the “Puss in Boots” ride, this resulted in our family moving further away from the head of the line. Our polite objection seemed poorly received and USS staff did not intervene.<br /><br />The division of express and non-express (same as fast pass at Disney) card holders on to rides was arbitrary and inconsistent. The was no fixed rule on any ride (don’t worry, the waits were long enough to make a fair assessment with a reasonable sized sample). <br /><br />Smaller families should not be disadvantaged by larger ones!<br /><br />I’d give the rides 5 stars if I could.","Family","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/15/f8/7a/f8/photo0jpg.jpg","Written January 5, 2019","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

We went there at noon upto  9pm but I got to ride 7 attractions - Battlestar Gallactica (Cyclon) being my first, my favorite and at the top of my list in rides.<br />Another favorite show was Waterworld- it was amazing! The actors, the explosions and stunts made us go WOW! Plus it was fun seeing people getting wet (good  thing I was only on the splash zone). All time favorite show.<br />3rd fave was Jurassic Park adventure, but people on the ride I was with got extremely wet. They had to change clothes  or use the dry pod for SGD 5. Ponchos are for sale for SGD10 lockers for rent for SGD 4 for an hour.<br />Some attractions though, like the mummy and have free lockers for an hour. Both attractions are pretty strict, no bags, or phones or wallets in your pocket.<br /><br />Cons:<br />the street show was okay but not as magical as TDR. We saw them for only a few minutes and they stopped at a place where a lot couldn’t see the performance.<br />Many things were expensive- food and souvenirs (SGD 2 for a penny and about SGD 35 for a USS shirt).<br />My parents who are about 60 wasn’t able to ride attractions just watched the shows.

Some tips for travelers who want to avoid crowds:<br />1. GO EARLY. Most people don't rock up to the park until 1-2pm or later which is peak time. The park opened at 10 and we were lined up at 9:30. We did an entire circuit of the park and the main big rides (the mummy, both battlestar galactica coasters, Jurassic park, shrek) plus watching the waterworld show and were done by 12:30 with wait times a max 10min. So get in early and you don't wait much at all. <br /><br />2. Bring an umbrella because there may be thunderstorms and you will get wet. <br /><br />3. Don't bother with ponchos for the Jurassic park ride as you barely get wet and they charge you $5 for them. <br /><br />4. Consider where you are - burgers are the only western food options and all the other food is beautiful unless you don't like Chinese, Indian or Malaysian cuisine. Also it's theme park food so obviously it's more expensive than usual. <br /><br />5. Do intense rides at the start of the day because you're more likely to get motion sickness when you're tired and/or full so get the roller coasters and the transformers ride done early.

The fast pass was essential with young children and it allowed us to ride everything we wanted each day. The park is clean and well maintained, there were a couple of break downs on the rollercoasters but the staff handled the situations well. The children aged 4, 10 and 12 had a blast watching shows, riding the various rides and meeting characters. The food and drinks are expensive in the parks but I guess it’s expected unfortunately. Overall a great trip and we will go back. It was a nice extra to see the Christmas shows and celebrations especially the street parade and snow effects that went with it.","Family","0","","Written January 1, 2019","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

This cost us $170 sgd return for 5 people. The journey there was really smooth and I would now suggest grab a taxi instead of a booked transfer. We left for the park at 4.15pm. We purchased the ‘after 5pm ticket package’ so couldn’t enter the park until after 5. The park was already busy though with day time guests. The park itself is good but does lack a lot of rides for teenagers. There’s really only 4 that I would class as ‘adult’ type rides. <br />The food at the park is awful. Really expensive and if you prefer western food there is very limited choices and the choices there are very ordinary.<br />We bought the unlimited fast passes which cost an additional $100 per person and I didn’t think this represented very good value at all. Most of the rides you wouldn’t want to go on a second time apart from the big roller coasters. Waiting time at the most was around 45 mins for normal pass holders but it was good getting the fast passes to save time. It depends on how long you want to wait for a ride as to whether a fast pass is worth the extra $$. <br />As we’d booked a return transfer we arranged to meet him at the Michael Hotel lobby which is right near the park and this was a very easy and simple location to get into and out of on a busy night. <br />We did have a good night and the kids really loved the park. It is a really good option for kids on New Years Eve. ","","0","","Written January 1, 2019","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

Even with the extra $100 ticket to get an ""Express Pass,' a couple of the best rides do not accept it and you end up in a queue that can take up to an hour to get on the ride which lasts maybe a couple of minutes. Best tip is to turn left inside the entrance to Madagascar and start the ride there, that means you;ll be in time for the Waterworld live show, which was amazing. This counterclockwise movement at least gets you on some less crowded rides. Jurassic Park is very popular you could pass through Madagascar and Waterworld and turn back. Taxis are very cheap in Singapore but there are a load of ways to get to Universal. Just remember there are a lot of pe3ople with the same idea as you! There are plenty of reasonable priced places to eat, didn't see a lot of spaces top bring food and most of the rides require you to leave all your backpacks at the start of the ride. There are some lockers but not every ride has one. There is only one ride the Cyclone Attack ride that pushes the boundaries. It's a park for younger teenagers and families and is not designed to shake your body up like a human milkshake.","","0","","Written January 1, 2019","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

The most amazing rides were Transformers the ride, Enchanted Airways, Jurassic Park Rapids Adventure, Madagascar the crate adventure and Canopy Flyer. The Revenge of the mummy ride was too scary and was really a  thriller. The Battlestar rides were also really thrilling and would turn your stomach upside down. The best shows were Shrek 4D Adventure and Lights Camera Action. If you go to Singapore and do not go there you'll regret it. You can also shop for nice things there and click photographs with your favourite characters. It was absolutely amazing and is small so it can be covered in one day.

Broadway Street is the most happening place here. <br />10. We did Madagascar ride, Shrek movie, Egyptian ride and The Lost World. Only Egyptian roller-coaster is good. <br />11. Outside the studio, there are many options for food. You can skip eating inside and pick the restaurant outside. It's cheaper and less crowded. <br />12. We missed the Transformers ride. It is supposed to be the best. Please do try. <br />13. To go home by MRT, walk to the Merlion and take the mono rail. Else you will have to wait in a long queue at Universal Studios.<br />14.

The park wasn't as big as I thought it was going to be, but there was plenty to do to keep you busy most of the day. <br />FYI: Weather, be warned if a storm come in, which happens a lot in Singapore, they shut down all the outdoor rides. <br />Also I would recommend arriving early afternoon as the queues really disappear in the last couple of hours (at least they did in our 1 off visit). <br />The best rides by far are the Battlestar Galactica rollacosters. After the storm, during the last hour of the parks opening time we had 0 waiting time for many of the rides, so we repeated rides or went back to worlds were the queues were really long during the day. <br />As an adult I loved both Battlestar rides and I enjoyed the Transformers ride. Apart from that all the rides were a little short or very tame.<br />I would suggest the park is for a younger family.<br />A great day out but I wouldn't go back in a hurry.","Family","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/15/e7/be/79/20181219-224706-largejpg.jpg","Written December 30, 2018","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

В самом парке на все Атракционы были очереди, ожидание 30-40 мин, но это нормально в таких парках. Брали с собой перекусы- фрукты, орешки, печеньки. Пружинали в итальянском ресторане на пляже. Атракционы не страшные, спокойно можно с детьми маленькими посещать.  Показалось, что само время катания очень короткое. Единственный  крутой по адреналину Атракцион- Египетский.

I would suggest going there first. My second and third favorites were the terminator and Jurassic park. There are a few really unexpected twists in the rides. <br />Some tips!

I’d suggest wearing pants or shorts with zipped pockets for your phone, camera, spectacles and watches! <br />The weather today was absolutely great. <br />The reason I gave the park a 3 is that it was overcrowded so we didn’t get to go on all the rides.

Jos siis kukkaron nyörit sallii, osta passi, jolla pääsee nopeampaa väylää tai käytä single riders -jonoa, joista yleensä pääsi nopeammin, mutta porukka tietysti eri vaunuihin. Ruokapaikoissa melko kallista ja tietysti hurjat jonot. Vesipulloja sai täytettyä puistossa eri paikoissa olevista juomapaikoista. Kaksi ulkona olevaa vuoristorataa tosi hyvät. Vesivuoristorata Jurassic Parkissa ihan kiva, mutta pisin jono. Revenge of Mummy Egyptin alueella hyvä sisävuoristorata. Madagaskarin pingviinien laivaan ei kannata tuntia enempää jonottaa. Kaikki em. on myös 9-vuotiaan pojan mielipiteitä. Menimme ja tulimme Sentosalle taksilla, joka oli nopein ja edullisin tapa. Puisto ei ole kauhean suuri (vertaan esim Orlandon Disney-puistoihin), joten yksi pitkä päivä riittää vierailuun, mutta saa siellä toki enemmänkin aikaa kulumaan.","Family","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/15/e1/50/6c/20181228-160708-largejpg.jpg

We’ve visited lots of different theme parks around Asia and this compared very poorly to the rest. I could go into a rant about how we felt that day, but I’ll limit it to a list of pros and cons!<br /><br />Pros:<br />- it looks beautiful and was very clean<br />- well themed areas<br />- the shows were great - Waterworld was awesome<br />- lots of shade and seating<br />- the food was priced quite reasonably for a theme park<br />- there were a group of 4 singers in the street who sung some fantastic Christmas songs - full of energy.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- everything seemed to be about getting you to part with more money. Things like the monorail should surely be free.<br />- queue times are a lie (double them)<br />- you are forced to use lockers for your bags when going on most rides. You have to pay a lot for the lockers and the price balloons if you queue for a while. It’s almost like you’re paying an entrance fee to the park as well as paying for each ride<br />- not enough vendors for drinks/food. 30 minute queues for a snack and 20 minutes queues just for a drink! Not good on a hot day.<br />- for some reason, Single-rider queues were not open. Staff kept saying “they will be open later”, but we checked and checked but it never happened. No idea why they didn’t open them - frustrating.<br />- we found that the staff were in general very rude through the day. Not what you would expect in a theme park where you usually have buoyant people who thank you and are willing to help. Instead, the staff often grunted at us or pointed.<br />- express tickets were crazy prices - triple what we paid to get in. We’re not sure whether they were discouraging single-riders so that people would go and desperately buy express tickets to get on the rides - a conspiracy theory! However, the express tickets didn’t even seem to speed things up by much. We overhead a normal 85 minute queue (for a kids’ ride) would be reduced to 40 minutes for express - still a huge wait and unlikely to actually be under an hour.<br />- we saw a lot of disgruntled children around the park and I daresay it was due to the lack of things for them to do. We felt really sorry for them.<br />- drinks prices were expensive. For a hot country, they should be making more water fountains available. Other attractions in Singapore really focus on sustainability and encourage people to refill bottles with water rather than wasting plastic.<br />- there was even a huge queue to get off Sentosa! Little tip, if you walk down to the next station along on the Sentosa Express, there are no queues there so you can hop on the monorail and get out of Sentosa quickly!<br />- too overcrowded. Universal, please don’t let this many people in! Half the amount of people = double the fun!<br /><br />I would really discourage spending a day here. Singapore has much more to offer. You’ll end up spending lots of money and have little to show for it in Universal. We were one of the first few inside the park and left at 4ish after the Waterworld show. I think we managed about 2 rides (The Mummy and a Transformers simulator) and saw the Special Effects show and Waterworld show. 4 things in 6 hours. Grim.","Friends","0","","Written December 28, 2018","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

Well we were wrong.. it's was very pack and we did not buy any fast past , we did not managed to try so many games,mainly due to the and due long q. And also that there is not much activities suitable for my 3 year old son. Some of the queue can take up to 210 mins..and we just walked <br />On food: the food is at least 3 times higher than outside food and many were serving process or fast foods..we end up eating nuggets and burgers for lunch and dinner..the kids meal come with the gift set , for today's its a container but the container was not able to latch when closed<br />The toilets are not so pleasant too..it's wet with tissues all over, the garbage bins are full according to my wife when visiting the ladies. For me the males toilet was acceptable although there are some which was wet. <br />The worst part is the staffs<br /> I saw ,.while queuing for a boat ride in far far land 4 young girls in their 7 to 9 was shouted by a staff for what the staff claimed that they used others fast pass. Instead of politely turn then down  he shouted at them with question :"" is this picture in the card look like you ? Don't use others card and q here. You are taking other people place""..I know he might be right but just a simple reply to say that the fast pass is not  transferable would be a better and polite way of replying? The 4 girls  was so scared that they just ran out quickly .it is a bit embassaring too as they are quite a lot of ppl queuing at that time<br /> I too had my embarrassing moment when i had dinner at mel's drive thru.. I paid some 70 dollars for food and drinks and filling in my soft drinks at the self service machine. When i came over refill again one of the staff shouted at me that i did not pay 3 Dollar for refill. She is shouting from the far right counter while i was refiling at the other end..She shouted in front of so many people on the queue and so.many people refilling...I was so embarrassed that i follow her to her counter, on the far right. I apologise that i was not aware that refilling require to pay extra..i saw so many people refilling some with their own bottle and some even with the minion container they purchased hence I thought it was FOC<br />I was asking her what is the fuss of shouting for a mere 3 dollar when she can just tell (and not shout)..her reply was rather simple,  it it was written at the displace at payment counter,  but seriously and humbly i did not see that. She then made me wait at the counter as she continue with they payment of the other customers before processing my payment ( imagine this.: she was taking orders from a customer when she saw me refilling , shouted at me and bring me to her counter , then continue serving the customer before attending to me: the 5 minutes was the most embarrassed moment of my life. After processing the payment she told me that i can continue refilling but I told her that i am not drinking this but I want to.prove a point that i was not doing that intentionally..","Family","0","","Written December 28, 2018","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

I have been to DisneyLand Anaheim & Paris, Universal Studios in LA and Movie World in Queensland, Australia, and I would rate them way higher than USS. These places have much better systems for ride “queueing” and seem to genuinely care that their guests have a good time. That was not our experience at USS.<br />The only thing we enjoyed was Lights, Camera, Action, and the WaterWorld show was pretty good.<br />We chose not to line up for a minimum of one hour & twenty minutes for the “good” rides - some rides were a two hour wait (we don’t believe any ride is worth wasting that amount of time for) and also chose not to buy a fast pass for ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY DOLLARS EACH!!!!! (And that was single use, multiple use was SGD160)<br />What I have since found out is the fast pass increases in price depending on demand, obviously in VERY high demand the day we visited.<br />Also, the service is incredibly SLOW. There appeared to be no sense of urgency at any place we bought food or drinks from, even though they had endless streams of people to serve. And as with most theme parks expect to pay double, if not triple, for food & drinks.<br />So lessons learnt, do not bother going at holiday time, buy your entry tickets AND fast passes online BEFORE you get there, and don’t expect to be served quickly. Also remember in Singapore it is HOT!!!<br />If I had my time again, I wouldn’t bother going. Very disappointing for our entire family.","Family","0","","Written December 28, 2018","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

Bought tickets from the hotel and weren’t informed about express tickets (should have done our research). So families with young kids, please get the express tickets to skip the queues. In the afternoon we waited 70min for a 1min ride on the cyclone. We got very tired.<br />Our highlight was Madagascar boat tour and the 3D show in the far away Kingdom 👌<br />I found the staff at the entrance of the Jurassic Park and Cyclone super rude. But not all of them hopefully. Standard queue at Jurassic also takes you through a compulsory photo shoot - not compulsory for express ticket holders though 🤔","Family","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/15/de/07/81/photo6jpg.jpg

Surprising though the jeep ride in Egyptian area did not have an express line and we queued for a long time for a children’s ride.<br />We did eat here at it wasn’t good but that is true of a lot of theme parks.<br />We had been to the Universal in LA many years ago and this was not a patch on that.<br />The staff were good though and very friendly but not sure the day warranted the very high price.","","0","","Written December 27, 2018","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

It's expensive to get in, so only come here if you've got loads of time in Singapore and want to fill up some of your time, if your schedule is tighter then don't bother, you won't miss anything.","Couples","0","","Written December 27, 2018","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."

I was in Singapore last weekend with a friend, and we took the opportunity to visit Universal. Great choice! Not as expensive as you would think, because all ride fees are included in the price of the entrance ticket. Lots of rides and stuff to keep everybody happy, and got thrown around and screamed like a kid on some of them. Was struck by how patient people were - standing in line for 20 + minutes for a ride? No problem, just strike up a friendship with the folks behind or in front. And had a flash back to my youth with 'lunch in the diner'. All in all, a great day!","Friends","0","","Written December 26, 2018","This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC."
