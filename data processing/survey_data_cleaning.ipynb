    "# Data Cleaning and Preparation for Survey Responses\n",

    "### 1: Remove Unnecessary Columns\n",
    "- The `Timestamp` column, which is not necessary for the analysis, is dropped to simplify the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2: Handle Missing Values\n",
    "- Placeholder values such as 'NIL', 'Na', 'n/a', empty strings, and similar variations are replaced with `NaN` to mark missing data consistently throughout the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3: Standardize Text Data\n",
    "- All column names are converted to lowercase and stripped of leading/trailing spaces to ensure consistency in comparisons.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4: Convert MCQ Columns to Categorical Data Types\n",
    "- All 37 multiple-choice question (MCQ) columns, such as age, gender, occupation, and ticket type, are converted to the `category` data type. This allows for faster operations like grouping and filtering on categorical data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5: Combine Free-Response Questions\n",
    "- The three open-ended questions are merged into a single column titled **\"Additional Comments or Suggestions\"** for simplification and easier analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6: Text Cleaning for Open-Ended Responses\n",
    "- The free-text responses are further cleaned by:\n",
    "    - Removing non-alphabetic characters (punctuation, numbers).\n",
    "    - Removing stopwords (both standard and custom stopwords such as 'na', 'nil', etc.).\n",
    "    - Applying lemmatization to reduce words to their base form, ensuring consistency in text analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7: Handling Inconsistent Responses\n",
    "- Certain survey responses are cleaned to ensure consistency between related questions:\n",
    "    - For the question **\"Did you use an Express Pass?\"**, if the response is **\"No\"**, any answers to the follow-up question **\"If your answer was 'yes', how satisfied were you with the value of the Express Pass?\"** are set to `NaN`.\n",
    "    - For the question **\"Did you purchase from any of the shopping outlets during your visit?\"**, if the response is **\"No\"**, any values provided for **\"How much did you approximately spend on merchandise?\"** are also set to `NaN`."
